## Fix Measurement Scaling

Your Three.js code implements a system for drawing lines on a plane and displaying their lengths in pixels. The issue with the measurement being off is likely due to a mismatch between the coordinate system of Three.js and the pixel coordinates.

Here are a few key points to consider for troubleshooting and resolving this issue:

1. **Coordinate System Mismatch**: Three.js uses a different coordinate system compared to screen pixels. The measurements you are calculating are in Three.js units, not pixels. You need to convert these units to screen pixels if you want to display the length in pixels.

2. **Scaling Factor**: If your scene or camera has any scaling applied, this will affect the measurements. You need to account for this scaling when converting from Three.js units to pixels.

3. **Camera Perspective**: If you are using a perspective camera, the apparent size of objects changes with their distance from the camera. This can make measurements in screen space non-trivial. Consider switching to an orthographic camera if you need consistent measurements regardless of depth.

4. **Raycaster Precision**: The `getMouseCoordinates` function uses a raycaster to find the intersection points on the plane. Make sure the precision of the raycaster and the size of your plane align well, so the intersection points are accurately calculated.

To convert the length from Three.js units to pixels, consider the following adjustments:

- Determine the scale factor between the Three.js units and actual screen pixels. This can be done by knowing the size of your plane in Three.js units and the actual size it takes up on the screen in pixels.
- Apply this scale factor to the calculated length to get the measurement in pixels.

Here's an example of how you might adjust the `lineLength` function to account for scaling:

```javascript
const Calculate = {
  lineLength(x1, y1, x2, y2, scaleFactor) {
    const threeJsUnitsLength = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x2 - x1, 2) + Math.pow(y2 - y1, 2));
    return threeJsUnitsLength * scaleFactor; // Convert to pixels
  }
};

// You need to determine scaleFactor based on your scene setup
```

Remember, the exact value of `scaleFactor` depends on your specific scene setup, including the size of the plane in Three.js units, the size of the rendered area in pixels, and any scaling applied to the camera or scene. This conversion is more straightforward with an orthographic camera, as it doesn't have perspective distortion.

## How?

Certainly! To calculate the `scaleFactor` in your Three.js scene, we need to understand how the scene's units relate to the actual pixel dimensions on the screen. This involves considering the camera's field of view, its aspect ratio, and its position relative to the plane.

Given your setup, we're dealing with a perspective camera, which makes the calculation a bit more complex due to the perspective distortion. The distance of the camera from the plane (`camera.position.z`) is crucial in this calculation. The field of view (`fov`) and the aspect ratio of the camera also play a significant role.

Here's a function to calculate the `scaleFactor` based on your scene setup:

```javascript
function calculateScaleFactor(camera, renderer) {
  // Calculate the visible height at the depth of the plane
  const distance = camera.position.z;
  const vFov = (camera.fov * Math.PI) / 180; // Convert vertical fov to radians
  const planeHeightAtDistance = 2 * Math.tan(vFov / 2) * distance;

  // Calculate the scale factor
  const screenHeight = renderer.domElement.clientHeight;
  const scaleFactor = screenHeight / planeHeightAtDistance;

  return scaleFactor;
}
```

This function calculates the height of the plane in the Three.js units that is visible in the camera's field of view at the given distance (`camera.position.z`). It then calculates the `scaleFactor` by dividing the actual screen height in pixels (`renderer.domElement.clientHeight`) by this calculated height.

To use this `scaleFactor` in your `lineLength` calculation:

```javascript
let length = Calculate.lineLength(
  startPoint.x,
  startPoint.y,
  endPoint.x,
  endPoint.y,
  calculateScaleFactor(camera, renderer)
).toFixed(2);
```

Remember, this approach assumes that the plane is perpendicular to the camera's view and covers the entire height of the camera's view at the distance specified. If your actual setup deviates from this, further adjustments might be needed.

## calculateScaleFactor

The `calculateScaleFactor` function calculates a scale factor used to convert distances measured in Three.js units to another unit of measurement, by accounting for the current perspective of the camera and the dimensions of the renderer's canvas. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Camera's Position and Field of View (FOV):** It first retrieves the camera's position (`camera.position.z`) and its vertical field of view (`camera.fov`). The FOV is converted from degrees to radians because trigonometric functions in JavaScript expect radians.

2. **Visible Height Calculation at a Specific Distance:** It calculates the visible height at the depth of the plane directly in front of the camera using the formula `2 * Math.tan(vFov / 2) * distance`. This uses basic trigonometry to find the height of a triangle where the camera's FOV acts as the apex angle and the distance from the camera to the plane is one of the triangle's sides.

3. **Scale Factor Calculation:** Finally, it calculates the scale factor by dividing the screen height (`renderer.domElement.clientHeight`) by the calculated plane height at the given distance. This scale factor can be used to convert the distance measured in Three.js units on the plane to real-world units on the screen.

This scaling is essential for applications like measuring distances in a 3D environment, where you need to relate the virtual distances within the 3D scene to real-world measurements, such as meters, centimeters, or in this case, microns.

## No line on zoom

Based on the provided code and the issue you're facing with line visibility when zoomed in, a few potential areas for improvement come to mind:

1. **Depth Buffer Precision:** When you zoom in very closely, issues with the depth buffer's precision can cause rendering artifacts or make objects disappear. One way to mitigate this is by adjusting the camera's near and far planes to be as tight around your scene as possible. This maximizes depth buffer precision.

2. **Depth Test for Line and Text Mesh:** If the line or text mesh is very close to other geometry in the scene, it might be getting clipped or not rendered due to depth testing. To ensure they are always visible, you could disable depth testing for these objects by setting their materials to ignore the depth test. For example:

   ```javascript
   lineMaterial.depthTest = false;
   textMaterial.depthTest = false;
   ```

   However, be aware that disabling depth testing means these objects will always render on top of everything else, which could lead to visual artifacts if that's not the intended behavior.
