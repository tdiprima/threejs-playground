<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">There are 40000 pixels per micron.  10000 microns per centimeter.  4 pixels per micron.  Explain why we would calculate the area in microns as area (in pixels) divided by 16, and the perimeter in microns as perimeter (in pixels) divided by 4.  (baz.js)</span>

To explain why we would calculate the area in microns as area divided by 16, and the perimeter in microns as perimeter divided by 4, we need to understand the relationship between pixels and microns, as well as how these units convert when dealing with area and perimeter.

### Understanding the Units and Conversions

1. **Pixels and Microns**:
   - 1 micron = 4 pixels (given).

2. **Conversion for Perimeter**:
   - Perimeter is a linear measurement (1D). 
   - Since 1 micron = 4 pixels, to convert a linear measurement in pixels to microns, you divide the pixel value by 4.
   - For example, if you have a perimeter of P pixels, the equivalent in microns is P/4 microns.

3. **Conversion for Area**:
   - Area is a square measurement (2D).
   - When converting from one unit of length to another in 2D, you need to consider the conversion factor squared.
   - Since 1 micron = 4 pixels, 1 square micron equals 4 x 4 = 16 square pixels.
   - To convert an area from pixels to microns, you divide the pixel area by 16.
   - For example, if you have an area of A pixels squared, the equivalent in square microns is A/16 square microns.

### Why Divide by 16 and 4

1. **Area Conversion**:
   - Given that 1 square micron = 16 square pixels:
     - Area in microns squared = Area in pixels squared / 16.

2. **Perimeter Conversion**:
   - Given that 1 micron = 4 pixels:
     - Perimeter in microns = Perimeter in pixels / 4.

### Example Calculation

1. **Perimeter**:
   - Suppose the perimeter of a polygon is 400 pixels.
   - To convert this perimeter to microns:
   - Perimeter in microns = 400 pixels / 4 = 100 microns

2. **Area**:
   - Suppose the area of a polygon is 1600 square pixels.
   - To convert this area to square microns:
   - Area in square microns = 1600 square pixels / 16 = 100 square microns

By understanding these conversion factors, we can correctly interpret and convert measurements between pixels and microns, ensuring accuracy in calculations related to perimeter and area.
