[Animated Aircraft Model](https://discourse.threejs.org/t/animated-aircraft-model-latest-version/33024)

### Here is my latest [demonstration](http://philcrowther.com/WebGL/Aircraft/FM2_cloud.html) of an aircraft in flight. In this version, you can toggle between camera views, including 

1. an external view that is fixed with the horizon, 
2. an external view that is locked to the aircraft, and 
3. an internal virtual cockpit view.

### This demo incorporates lessons I have learned over the past year about objects, including

1. [how to attach the camera to different objects](http://philcrowther.com/Aviation/FSD11_Cameras.html); and
2. [how to rotate the aircraft using linked objects](http://philcrowther.com/Aviation/FSD10_Rotations.html)

## Flight Simulation

I was able to come up with a simplified flight simulation using a method described on my [aviation webpage](http://philcrowther.com/Aviation/) in some [detail](http://philcrowther.com/Aviation/ACF03_comps.html)

Essentially, I treat thrust and drag as operating along the flight path and lift and gravity as fligth-path deflectors.
