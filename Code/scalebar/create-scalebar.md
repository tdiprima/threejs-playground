Right now, there isn't a built-in feature in the three.js library to create a scale bar dynamically.

However, it is entirely possible to create a dynamic scale bar yourself:

### 1. **Create Scale Bar as a Mesh:**
First, create a scale bar as a Three.js mesh (like a `THREE.PlaneGeometry` or `THREE.BoxGeometry`) and add it to your scene.

### 2. **Position Scale Bar:**
Position the scale bar mesh in the lower-left corner of your camera's viewport. You might need to constantly adjust its position relative to the camera, especially if you are using a perspective camera.

### 3. **Update Scale Bar Size:**
You would need to dynamically adjust the scale bar's size based on the camera's zoom level or distance from the object. To do this, you would listen for changes to the camera's `zoom` or `position` properties and update the scale bar's `scale` property accordingly.

### 4. **Add Text Labels:**
You might also want to add text labels to indicate the scale. This might be a bit trickier but can be achieved using the `THREE.TextGeometry` class or using HTML elements positioned over the canvas.

### A general pseudocode outline:

```javascript
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera();
// ... set up renderer, orbit controls, etc.

// Create scale bar mesh
const scaleBarGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(1, 0.1);
const scaleBarMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0xffffff});
const scaleBar = new THREE.Mesh(scaleBarGeometry, scaleBarMaterial);
scene.add(scaleBar);

// Update function
function update() {
  // Update scale bar position
  // Calculate position in the viewport, perhaps using vector projecton
  // ...

  // Update scale bar size
  // Calculate size based on camera zoom or distance
  const scale = calculateScale(camera.zoom); // You need to define calculateScale
  scaleBar.scale.set(scale, 1, 1);

  // Update text labels
  // ...
}

// Animation loop
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  update();
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}

animate();
```

### Notes:
- The `calculateScale` function needs to be defined based on how you want to calculate the scale. This might involve some trial and error or math based on your camera setup and scene dimensions.
- You might need to convert world units to screen units or vice versa, depending on your implementation.
- Adjusting the size and position of the scale bar mesh can be tricky, so you may need to experiment and adjust the calculations to fit your specific scene and camera setup.
  
### Conclusion:
While the pseudo-code and steps provided should guide you in the right direction, you need to make adjustments according to your requirements. For precise steps, I would recommend referring to the three.js documentation and other resources that are current as of your asking. The community forums and discussions related to three.js might provide more specific solutions and examples as well.
