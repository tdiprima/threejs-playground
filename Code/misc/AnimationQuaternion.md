Sure! Let’s create a simple animation using both `VectorKeyframeTrack` (for position) and `QuaternionKeyframeTrack` (for rotation) in three.js. I'll explain the key steps along the way.

### What are VectorKeyframeTrack and QuaternionKeyframeTrack?

- **`VectorKeyframeTrack`**: Used to animate properties like positions, scales, or other vector-based attributes.
- **`QuaternionKeyframeTrack`**: Used for animating rotations as quaternions. Quaternions avoid gimbal lock and ensure smooth rotations.

### Example: Animate a cube to move and rotate in three.js

In this example, we’ll animate a cube's position using `VectorKeyframeTrack` and its rotation using `QuaternionKeyframeTrack`.

### Explanation

1. **Setting Up the Scene**: We create a basic three.js scene with a cube, a camera, and a renderer.
2. **VectorKeyframeTrack**: We animate the cube's position over three keyframes at times `0`, `1`, and `2` seconds. The cube moves from `(0, 0, 0)` to `(2, 2, 0)` and finally to `(0, 2, 2)`.
3. **QuaternionKeyframeTrack**: We rotate the cube at the same keyframe times using quaternions:
    - At time `0`, there's no rotation (`0, 0, 0, 1`).
    - At time `1`, the cube is rotated 90 degrees around the Y-axis (`0, 0.707, 0, 0.707`).
    - At time `2`, it's rotated 180 degrees around the Y-axis (`0, 1, 0, 0`).
4. **AnimationClip**: Combines the position and rotation keyframes into a single animation.
5. **AnimationMixer**: Applies the animation to the cube and updates it on each frame in the `animate` loop.

This setup moves and rotates the cube smoothly over time. You can modify the keyframes to create different motion and rotations!
