## Using sine for Smoothness

<span style="color:blue;">Why do we use `sin` to set position x,y,z (as opposed to `cos` or `tan` or anything else)?</span>

```js
function render(time) {
  time *= 0.001; // convert to seconds

  mesh.position.set(
    Math.sin(time * 1.2) * 5,
    Math.sin(time * 1.1) * 5,
    Math.sin(time * 1.3) * 10
  );
  renderer.render(scene, camera);

  requestAnimationFrame(render);
}
```

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why `sin` (sine) is used in this context!

The `sin` function is a mathematical function that helps describe a smooth, repeating wave-like pattern. It's often used in computer graphics, like in your Three.js code, to create smooth, natural movements.

Let's break down your code:

### 1. Time Factor:

```js
time *= 0.001;
```
 
converts the time from milliseconds to seconds. This is because the time variable probably increases too quickly (since it's in milliseconds), and using it directly would make the movement too fast to be natural.

### 2. Using sine for Positioning:

```js
Math.sin(time * 1.2) * 5
```

- This line uses `sin` to calculate the x-coordinate of the mesh's position. The `sin` function oscillates between -1 and 1. By multiplying the time by 1.2, you change how fast the wave oscillates. Multiplying the result by 5 scales the wave, so the x-coordinate moves between -5 and 5.

- The y and z coordinates are set in a similar way, but with slightly different multipliers for time. This creates a varied movement pattern for each axis.

### Now, why use `sin` instead of `cos` or `tan`?

- **`sin` and `cos`**: Both `sin` and `cos` are similar in that they produce smooth, repeating wave-like patterns. The main difference is their starting point; `sin` starts at 0 (when time is 0), while `cos` starts at 1. You could use `cos` instead of `sin` if you wanted a different starting position but the same type of movement.
  
- **`tan` (tangent)**: `tan` is quite different from `sin` and `cos`. It doesn't oscillate between -1 and 1. Instead, it goes off to infinity at certain points (which are known as "asymptotes"). This would make the movement very erratic and unnatural, with sudden jumps to extremely high or low values, which is not usually desired in smooth animations.

In summary, `sin` is used in your code to create smooth, natural, and repeating movements for the mesh in your 3D scene. It's a common choice for animations because of the way it smoothly transitions between values, creating the appearance of natural motion.
