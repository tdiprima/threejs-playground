## Leaflet & Three.js Integration

<span style="color:#0000dd;">Please show me a working example of how to add a building in three.js to a map made by leaflet.js</span>

Sure, I can help guide you through a basic example of how to integrate a 3D model (e.g., a building) created in Three.js into a map created with Leaflet.js. We'll need to use the Leaflet's functionality to create a custom layer where our Three.js scene will be rendered.

Please note that this is a simplistic example and real-world scenarios might require more fine-tuning and dealing with the complexities of both libraries.

First, let's create the Leaflet map:

```javascript
// Create leaflet map
let map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);

L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
    maxZoom: 19,
}).addTo(map);
```

<br>
In this example, the map is centered on the coordinates (51.505, -0.09), which is roughly in the center of London, and OpenStreetMap is used for the tiles.

Next, let's create a custom layer for our Three.js scene:

```javascript
// Create custom layer
let ThreeLayer = L.Layer.extend({

    onAdd: function(map) {
        this.map = map;
        let size = this.map.getSize();

        // Create a new WebGL renderer and append it to the Leaflet's overlay pane
        this.renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
        this.renderer.setSize(size.x, size.y);
        this.renderer.domElement.style.position = 'absolute';
        this.renderer.domElement.style.top = 0;
        this.renderer.domElement.style.left = 0;
        let panes = this.map.getPanes();
        panes.overlayPane.appendChild(this.renderer.domElement);

        // Create the Three.js scene and camera
        this.scene = new THREE.Scene();
        this.camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(60, size.x / size.y, 1, 100000);
        this.camera.position.z = 500;
    },

    getEvents: function() {
        return {
            viewreset: this.onViewReset
        };
    },

    onViewReset: function() {
        this.render();
    },

    render: function() {
        this.renderer.render(this.scene, this.camera);
    }
});
```

<br>
In this code, we are creating a new WebGL renderer and appending it to the Leaflet's overlay pane. We are also creating a new Three.js scene and a perspective camera.

Now, let's add our custom layer to the map:

```javascript
// Add custom layer to map
let threeLayer = new ThreeLayer();
threeLayer.addTo(map);
```

<br>
Finally, let's add a 3D model (a box) to our scene:

```javascript
// Add a building
let geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(200, 200, 200);
let material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0x00ff00});
let cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
threeLayer.scene.add(cube);

// Update cube position to correspond to map location
let position = map.latLngToLayerPoint(new L.LatLng(51.505, -0.09));
cube.position.set(position.x, position.y, 0);

threeLayer.render();
```

<br>
In this last piece of code, we're creating a cube and adding it to our scene. Then, we convert the LatLng coordinates to layer points and set the cube's position.

Keep in mind that there is more work to be done to keep the 3D object positioned correctly when the map is panned or zoomed, and to possibly consider the map's current scale when determining the size of the 3D object.

In more complex scenarios, you might want to use GIS data to create your 3D buildings or load 3D models using Three.js loaders. This will also involve converting geographic coordinates to the Cartesian coordinates used by Three.js.

## Revision?

The code example provided doesn't rely on specific versions of Leaflet.js or Three.js. The basic principles applied should work for most recent versions of both libraries. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021:

- The latest version of Leaflet.js was 1.7.1, released in August 2020.
- The latest version of Three.js was r131, released in September 2021.
- <span style="color:#ff00cc;">There is no r131 in CDN, tho.</span>

Remember that as with any third-party library, it's good practice to check the documentation for the version you are using, as APIs can change over time.

## Error

Of course.

<span style="color:#0000dd;">There's no map or cube.  All I see is a white screen.  Is there something else I need to do to render this?</span>

I'm sorry for the confusion. The above code snippets are fragments for using Three.js and Leaflet.js together. They're not intended to be a complete, ready-to-run application.

Here is a more complete example that should run in a web page, as long as you are including the necessary JavaScript libraries. Be sure to replace `[PATH_TO_LEAFLET_CSS]`, `[PATH_TO_LEAFLET_JS]` and `[PATH_TO_THREE_JS]` with the correct paths to the respective CSS and JS files.

    this.map = map;
    let size = this.map.getSize();
    this.renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ alpha: true });
    this.renderer.setSize(size.x, size.y);
    this.renderer.domElement.style.position = 'absolute';
    this.renderer.domElement.style.top = 0;
    this.renderer.domElement.style.left = 0;
    let panes = this.map.getPanes();
    panes.overlayPane.appendChild(this.renderer.domElement);

    // Create the Three.js Scene and Camera
    this.scene = new THREE.Scene();
    this.camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(60, size.x / size.y, 1, 100000);
    this.camera.position.z = 500;

    // Add Three.js object
    let geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(200, 200, 200);
    let material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0x00ff00});
    this.cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
    this.scene.add(this.cube);

    this.animate();
  },

  animate: function() {
    // Update Three.js scene
    this.cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
    this.cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
    this.renderer.render(this.scene, this.camera);

    // Next frame
    requestAnimationFrame(this.animate.bind(this));
  }
});

// Add ThreeLayer to the map
let threeLayer = new ThreeLayer();
threeLayer.addTo(map);
```

<br>

This example creates a spinning cube on top of the Leaflet map. Remember, this is a simplified example and the cube will not stay in place when the map is panned or zoomed. Adding that functionality requires additional work.

## Paint Polygon

<span style="color:#0000dd;">Any idea how I can use the PaintPolygon plugin with three.js, but having an image as the background instead of a map?</span>

One approach could be to use Leaflet's ImageOverlay to add an image as a base layer to your map. This way, you can still create a map and use Leaflet's plugins, but have an image as the background instead of a map. Here's an example:

```javascript
var imageUrl = 'https://example.com/my-image.jpg', // your image url here
    imageBounds = [[40.712216, -74.22655], [40.773941, -74.12544]];

L.imageOverlay(imageUrl, imageBounds).addTo(map);
```

<br>

In this code, `imageUrl` should be replaced with the URL of your image, and `imageBounds` should be replaced with the geographic bounds of your image. This example places the image over a part of New Jersey, USA.

However, this approach has a significant limitation: Leaflet is still a 2D library, so the image will be projected onto a flat surface. If you want to map the image onto a 3D object, you'll have to use Three.js's texture mapping functionality.

You could potentially handle user interactions with Leaflet, and then use those interactions to update the Three.js scene. For instance, if you want users to be able to draw polygons onto the image, you could let them draw the polygons on a transparent Leaflet map overlaid on the Three.js scene, then replicate the drawn polygons in the Three.js scene as 3D objects.

If you're trying to create a more complex 3D application, you may want to look into using a full-featured 3D library instead of trying to adapt a 2D mapping library. There are libraries such as **A-Frame** or **Babylon.js** that might be more suitable for this task.

## Functionality

<span style="color:#0000dd;">I see what you mean.  But do either A-Frame or Babylon.js have the functionality that PaintPolygon.js has?</span>

As of my last knowledge cutoff in September 2021, neither A-Frame nor Babylon.js has built-in functionality equivalent to the Leaflet.PaintPolygon.js plugin. The functionality of allowing users to draw polygons by clicking to create vertices is very specific to 2D map interaction, and isn't a standard feature of 3D libraries.

That said, you could potentially create similar functionality using these libraries, but it would require more work. You'd need to handle user input events to create vertices and construct polygons based on those vertices.

Here's a rough idea of how you might approach it:

- Listen for click events on the canvas element where you're rendering the 3D scene.
- When a click event occurs, perform a raycast from the camera through the click point to identify the point in the 3D world that was clicked.
- Add a vertex at the clicked location. If this is the first vertex, start a new polygon. Otherwise, add a new edge to the existing polygon.
- When the user finishes drawing the polygon (perhaps by double-clicking, or clicking on the starting vertex), finish the polygon and add it to the scene.

This would allow users to create 3D polygons by clicking on the scene. However, it's a fairly complex task, and may require a good understanding of 3D geometry and the library you're using.

As always, you should also consider whether this is the best approach for your use case. Depending on what you're trying to achieve, there might be simpler alternatives that could work just as well. If you want to provide more information about your project, I might be able to give more specific advice.

## Hollow Brush

<span style="color:#0000dd;">I can do all of that.  What I'm stuck on is how to create the hollow-brush part.  Do you know what I mean?  Like, instead of drawing with a very thick solid line, I want to be able to draw with the outline of a solid line.  Where the inside is hollow...</span>

Yes, I understand what you're trying to achieve. You want to draw polygons with a "hollow" center, showing only the outlines. This is a bit more complicated than drawing a solid polygon, as you can't simply use a line loop for complex shapes (shapes that cross over themselves, have holes, etc.).

You might want to create a `THREE.LineLoop` for simple polygons (those that don't cross over themselves or have holes). Here's an example:

```javascript
let vertices = new THREE.Geometry();

// Assume polygonPoints is an array of THREE.Vector3 representing your polygon vertices
polygonPoints.forEach(point => {
    vertices.vertices.push(point);
});

let lineMaterial = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ color: 0x000000 });
let lineLoop = new THREE.LineLoop(vertices, lineMaterial);

scene.add(lineLoop);
```

<br>
For complex polygons (those with holes, or that cross over themselves), you'll need to triangulate the polygon into faces. This is a complex process, but fortunately there are libraries like `earcut` that can handle it for you. Once you've triangulated the polygon, you can create a `THREE.LineSegments` object to render the edges:

```javascript
// Assume polygonPoints is an array of THREE.Vector2 representing your polygon vertices
let indices = earcut(polygonPoints.flat(), null, 2);
let geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry().setFromPoints(polygonPoints);
geometry.setIndex(indices);

let lineMaterial = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ color: 0x000000 });
let lineSegments = new THREE.LineSegments(geometry, lineMaterial);

scene.add(lineSegments);
```

<br>

In both of these examples, the polygon will appear as a hollow shape, with only the outline visible. If you want to make the outline thicker, you can use a `Line2` object from the `three.js` examples, which supports linewidth as a property. Alternatively, you can use a `MeshLine` from the THREE.MeshLine library, which also supports line thickness.

These are just starting points, and depending on your exact use case, you may need to modify or extend these examples. But they should give you a good idea of how to create "hollow" polygons in three.js.

## Complete example

I'll provide a complete example of creating a 'hollow' polygon in Three.js, using the earcut library for triangulation as discussed previously. I'll assume that you are manually defining the vertices of your polygon and that these vertices are in the 2D plane (i.e., they have a z-coordinate of 0).

Please note that this is not an entirely trivial example, so don't worry if it takes a bit of time to understand. I'll try to provide some explanation along the way to help. 

First, make sure to include the earcut and three.js libraries in your HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Three.js Hollow Polygon</title>
        <style>
            body { margin: 0; }
            canvas { display: block; }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="[PATH_TO_EARCUT.JS]"></script>
        <script src="[PATH_TO_THREE.JS]"></script>
        <script src="app.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

Then, in your `app.js` file, create the scene, camera, renderer and polygon:

```javascript
// Create the scene and camera
let scene = new THREE.Scene();
let camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
camera.position.z = 5;

// Create the renderer
let renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

// Assume that polygonPoints is an array of x, y coordinate pairs for the polygon vertices
let polygonPoints = [
    new THREE.Vector2(-1, -1),
    new THREE.Vector2(1, -1),
    new THREE.Vector2(1, 1),
    new THREE.Vector2(-1, 1)
];

// We use earcut to triangulate the polygon and get indices
let triangleIndices = earcut(polygonPoints.reduce((acc, val) => acc.concat(val.toArray()), []));

// Convert polygon points to 3D space by adding Z axis and add to geometry
let geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry().setFromPoints(polygonPoints.map(p => new THREE.Vector3(p.x, p.y, 0)));
geometry.setIndex(triangleIndices);

// Create a wireframe material
let material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00, wireframe: true });

// Use the geometry and material to create a mesh
let polygonMesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);

// Add the polygon to the scene
scene.add(polygonMesh);

// Animation function
function animate() {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
}

animate();
```

<br>

Replace `[PATH_TO_EARCUT.JS]` and `[PATH_TO_THREE.JS]` with the actual paths to the respective libraries.

Please keep in mind that this example is very basic and doesn't handle interactions. For instance, you'll need to listen for mouse events to allow the user to add vertices, and you'll need to update the mesh whenever a new vertex is added. This might involve creating a new geometry and mesh for each update, or you might be able to update the existing geometry depending on your specific requirements.
