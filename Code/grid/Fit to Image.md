## Fit to image

To ensure that the grid fits the exact size of the image in your Three.js scene, you should adjust the size and position of the grid based on the dimensions of the image texture. Since the plane geometry is already scaled to match the aspect ratio of the image, you need to apply similar scaling to the grid.

Here's how you can modify the `addGrid` function to achieve this:

1. **Calculate the Aspect Ratio:** You have already calculated the aspect ratio of the image when creating the plane. Use this aspect ratio to scale the grid accordingly.

2. **Scale the Grid:** Apply the same scaling to the grid as you did to the plane. This ensures that the grid matches the size of the image.

3. **Position the Grid:** Ensure the grid is correctly positioned to overlay the image. This might involve adjusting the position to align with the plane.

Here is the modified `addGrid` function:

```javascript
function addGrid(plane, aspect) {
  grid.scale.set(1.0, aspect, 1.0); // Scale the grid to match the image aspect ratio
  grid.position.copy(plane.position); // Position the grid to overlay the plane
}
```

And modify the part where you call `addGrid` in your code to pass the `plane` and `aspect`:

```javascript
// Modify the button event listener
addGrid(plane, aspect);
```

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">The button event handler had to go inside the TextureLoader callback.</span>

In this updated code:

- The `addGrid` function now takes two parameters: `plane` and `aspect`. It scales and positions the grid based on the plane's size and aspect ratio.
- When you call `addGrid`, make sure to pass the `plane` object and the `aspect` ratio you calculated earlier. This way, the grid will match the size and position of the image.

## GridHelper

GridHelper is not composed of individual segments that can be colored independently.

```js
// faithful-squirrel.html, 9978d7b

function colorGridSquare() {
  raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);

  // Assumes each square is a separate object; for GridHelper, additional work is needed
  const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true);

  if (intersects.length > 0) {
    // Get first intersected object and change its color
    const square = intersects[0].object;
    square.material.color.set(0xff0000); // Set to desired color
  }
}

document.addEventListener('mousedown', colorGridSquare, false);
```

## Make the grid appear at the center of the current view

To make the grid appear at the center of the current view, similarly to how we handled the crosshairs, you need to update the grid's position based on the camera's orientation and position each time the grid is added or the camera's view changes. This involves calculating the center point of the camera's view and positioning the grid accordingly.

Here's how you can modify your `addGrid` function to achieve this, and add functionality to update the grid's position dynamically:

1. **Calculate the Center Point**: When adding the grid, calculate the center point of the camera's current view to position the grid at this location.
2. **Update Grid Position on Camera Movement**: If you're using OrbitControls or similar for camera navigation, listen for changes (e.g., the `change` event in OrbitControls) and update the grid's position accordingly.

I'll provide an updated version of your `addGrid` function to calculate and set the initial position of the grid based on the camera's current direction and position. I'll also include a function to update the grid's position dynamically:

```javascript
function addGrid() {
    const gridSize = 100; // Define the size of the grid
    const squareSize = 100; // Define the size of each square in the grid
    grid = new THREE.Group(); // Group to hold the grid

    for (let i = 0; i < gridSize; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < gridSize; j++) {
            const geometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(squareSize, squareSize);
            const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x0000ff, transparent: true, opacity: 0.1 });
            const square = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);

            // Position each square
            square.position.set(i * squareSize - gridSize * squareSize / 2, j * squareSize - gridSize * squareSize / 2, 0);
            grid.add(square);
        }
    }

    updateGridPosition(); // Calculate and set the initial position of the grid
    scene.add(grid);
}

function updateGridPosition() {
    if (!grid) return; // If the grid doesn't exist, exit the function

    // Calculate the center of the camera's current view
    const vector = new THREE.Vector3(); // Vector pointing to the center of the screen
    const direction = new THREE.Vector3();
    camera.getWorldDirection(direction);
    vector.addVectors(camera.position, direction.multiplyScalar(1000)); // Adjust distance based on your scene

    // Set grid position to match the calculated center point
    grid.position.copy(vector);
}

// Assuming you have an instance of OrbitControls named `orbitControls`
orbitControls.addEventListener('change', function() {
    if (isGridAdded) {
        updateGridPosition();
    }
});
```

In this code, `updateGridPosition` calculates the center of the camera's view and moves the grid to this position. The `orbitControls.addEventListener('change', function() {...})` part assumes you have OrbitControls set up and you're listening to its change events to update the grid's position whenever the camera moves. If you're not using OrbitControls or if your controls have a different way of notifying about changes, you'll need to adjust this part accordingly.

The key addition here is dynamically setting the grid's position to ensure it appears at the center of the current view, which is particularly useful when navigating large scenes or focusing on specific areas within your application.
