## Create Interactive Grid

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">I have three.js code that loads an image onto a plane.  Now, I need to draw a grid of lines over the image, and allow the user to click-drag their mouse through the grid, so that each square that they drag their mouse over gets colored in red.  And then I need to be able to save the location information of the colored squares for future use.</span>

To achieve your goal, you will need to modify your existing Three.js code to include the following functionalities:

1. **Create a Grid Over the Image**: You can use a `THREE.GridHelper` or a custom grid of lines for this. However, `THREE.GridHelper` might not align perfectly with your image, so drawing a custom grid might be better.

2. **Detect Mouse Movements**: Use raycasting to detect where the mouse is pointing and highlight the corresponding grid square.

3. **Color the Grid Squares Red**: Modify the color of the grid square where the mouse is dragged.

4. **Save the Location Information**: Store the coordinates of the colored squares for future use.

Here's an extended version of your code that includes these functionalities:

[funky-empress.html](funky-empress.html)

This code sets up the necessary elements and includes the basic logic for detecting mouse movements over the grid. You will need to fill in some specifics, especially for determining the exact grid square based on the face index and for coloring it red. This could involve modifying the geometry or using a secondary overlay mesh.

For saving the colored squares, you can choose a method that suits your application, such as sending the data to a server or storing it locally.

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">onmousemove, I get "Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "materialIndex", face is null"</span>

The error you're encountering, "Uncaught TypeError: can't access property 'materialIndex', face is null", suggests that the `intersect` object sometimes doesn't have a `face` property. This can happen if the raycaster doesn't intersect a face of the mesh. Let's add a check to ensure that `face` is not null before attempting to access its properties.

Additionally, for coloring individual grid squares, we need a more nuanced approach. The `PlaneGeometry` in Three.js doesn't inherently support individual face coloring. One workaround is to create a grid of individual plane geometries, each representing a square in the grid, and then change the material of these individual planes when they are interacted with.

Here's a revised version of the onMouseMove function and additional modifications to handle individual grid square coloring.

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">The new grid didn't work; I see one white rectangle.</span>

```javascript
// ... [previous setup code]

let gridSquares = []; // Array to hold individual grid squares

function addGrid(geometry) {
  const size = 4, step = 4 / 40; // Assuming 40x40 grid

  for (let i = 0; i < size; i += step) {
    for (let j = 0; j < size; j += step) {
      const squareGeom = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(step, step);
      const squareMat = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xffffff, side: THREE.DoubleSide });
      const square = new THREE.Mesh(squareGeom, squareMat);
      square.position.set(i - size / 2 + step / 2, 0.01, j - size / 2 + step / 2); // Slightly above the main plane
      scene.add(square);
      gridSquares.push(square);
    }
  }
}

function onMouseMove(event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
  mouse.y = - (event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;

  raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);

  const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(gridSquares);

  if (intersects.length > 0) {
    const intersect = intersects[0];
    const square = intersect.object;

    // Change color of the square to red
    square.material.color.set(0xff0000);

    // Add square position to the coloredSquares array if not already included
    const squarePosition = `${square.position.x},${square.position.z}`;
    if (!coloredSquares.includes(squarePosition)) {
      coloredSquares.push(squarePosition);
    }
  }
}

// ... [rest of your code]
```

This code creates a grid of individual squares (planes) and changes the color of the square that the mouse intersects. The position of each colored square is stored in a format like "x,z" for future use. Adjust the grid size and steps according to your needs.

## Fit to image

To ensure that the grid fits the exact size of the image in your Three.js scene, you should adjust the size and position of the grid based on the dimensions of the image texture. Since the plane geometry is already scaled to match the aspect ratio of the image, you need to apply similar scaling to the grid.

Here's how you can modify the `addGrid` function to achieve this:

1. **Calculate the Aspect Ratio:** You have already calculated the aspect ratio of the image when creating the plane. Use this aspect ratio to scale the grid accordingly.

2. **Scale the Grid:** Apply the same scaling to the grid as you did to the plane. This ensures that the grid matches the size of the image.

3. **Position the Grid:** Ensure the grid is correctly positioned to overlay the image. This might involve adjusting the position to align with the plane.

[faithful-squirrel.html](faithful-squirrel.html)

Here is the modified `addGrid` function:

```javascript
function addGrid(plane, aspect) {
  grid.scale.set(1.0, aspect, 1.0); // Scale the grid to match the image aspect ratio
  grid.position.copy(plane.position); // Position the grid to overlay the plane
}
```

And modify the part where you call `addGrid` in your code to pass the `plane` and `aspect`:

```javascript
// Modify the button event listener
addGrid(plane, aspect);
```

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">The button event handler had to go inside the TextureLoader callback.</span>

In this updated code:

- The `addGrid` function now takes two parameters: `plane` and `aspect`. It scales and positions the grid based on the plane's size and aspect ratio.
- When you call `addGrid`, make sure to pass the `plane` object and the `aspect` ratio you calculated earlier. This way, the grid will match the size and position of the image.

## GridHelper

GridHelper is not composed of individual segments that can be colored independently.

```js
// faithful-squirrel.html, 9978d7b

function colorGridSquare() {
  raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);

  // Assumes each square is a separate object; for GridHelper, additional work is needed
  const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true);

  if (intersects.length > 0) {
    // Get first intersected object and change its color
    const square = intersects[0].object;
    square.material.color.set(0xff0000); // Set to desired color
  }
}

document.addEventListener('mousedown', colorGridSquare, false);
```

## Make the grid appear at the center of the current view

To make the grid appear at the center of the current view, similarly to how we handled the crosshairs, you need to update the grid's position based on the camera's orientation and position each time the grid is added or the camera's view changes. This involves calculating the center point of the camera's view and positioning the grid accordingly.

Here's how you can modify your `addGrid` function to achieve this, and add functionality to update the grid's position dynamically:

1. **Calculate the Center Point**: When adding the grid, calculate the center point of the camera's current view to position the grid at this location.
2. **Update Grid Position on Camera Movement**: If you're using OrbitControls or similar for camera navigation, listen for changes (e.g., the `change` event in OrbitControls) and update the grid's position accordingly.

I'll provide an updated version of your `addGrid` function to calculate and set the initial position of the grid based on the camera's current direction and position. I'll also include a function to update the grid's position dynamically:

```javascript
function addGrid() {
    const gridSize = 100; // Define the size of the grid
    const squareSize = 100; // Define the size of each square in the grid
    grid = new THREE.Group(); // Group to hold the grid

    for (let i = 0; i < gridSize; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < gridSize; j++) {
            const geometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(squareSize, squareSize);
            const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x0000ff, transparent: true, opacity: 0.1 });
            const square = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);

            // Position each square
            square.position.set(i * squareSize - gridSize * squareSize / 2, j * squareSize - gridSize * squareSize / 2, 0);
            grid.add(square);
        }
    }

    updateGridPosition(); // Calculate and set the initial position of the grid
    scene.add(grid);
}

function updateGridPosition() {
    if (!grid) return; // If the grid doesn't exist, exit the function

    // Calculate the center of the camera's current view
    const vector = new THREE.Vector3(); // Vector pointing to the center of the screen
    const direction = new THREE.Vector3();
    camera.getWorldDirection(direction);
    vector.addVectors(camera.position, direction.multiplyScalar(1000)); // Adjust distance based on your scene

    // Set grid position to match the calculated center point
    grid.position.copy(vector);
}

// Assuming you have an instance of OrbitControls named `orbitControls`
orbitControls.addEventListener('change', function() {
    if (isGridAdded) {
        updateGridPosition();
    }
});
```

In this code, `updateGridPosition` calculates the center of the camera's view and moves the grid to this position. The `orbitControls.addEventListener('change', function() {...})` part assumes you have OrbitControls set up and you're listening to its change events to update the grid's position whenever the camera moves. If you're not using OrbitControls or if your controls have a different way of notifying about changes, you'll need to adjust this part accordingly.

The key addition here is dynamically setting the grid's position to ensure it appears at the center of the current view, which is particularly useful when navigating large scenes or focusing on specific areas within your application.

## Remove the darn grid

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">I have a grid of squares that I can toggle on and off.  I made a change in the `toggleGridVisibility` function, where if the square is not colored, it should be removed from the scene.  Except I still have rows of blue squares still remaining.</span>

```js
// Now called "removeGrid"
function toggleGridVisibility() {
  grid.children.forEach(square => {
    if (!square.userData.colored) {
      // square.material.opacity = square.material.opacity === opacity ? 0 : opacity;
      removeObject(square);
    }
  });
}
```

```js
function removeGrid() {
  if (grid) {
    scene.remove(grid);
    grid = undefined;
  }
}
```

The issue with rows of blue squares remaining even after attempting to remove the non-colored ones might be related to how the grid squares are being iterated and modified within the `toggleGridVisibility` function. When you modify a collection (like removing elements) while iterating over it, you can run into problems because the collection's size and the elements' indices change. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as skipping elements or not removing them as intended.

In your `toggleGridVisibility` function, you're iterating through `grid.children` and attempting to remove squares directly from it. This could potentially skip some squares due to the changing indices of the remaining items in the collection after removals.

A safer approach would be to collect the squares that need to be removed in a separate array and then iterate over this array to remove them from the grid. This way, the original collection's iteration is not affected by the removal process. Here's how you could adjust your `toggleGridVisibility` function:

```javascript
function toggleGridVisibility() {
  // Collect squares to be removed
  const squaresToRemove = grid.children.filter(square => !square.userData.colored);

  // Remove the collected squares
  squaresToRemove.forEach(square => removeObject(square));
}
```

This method first identifies all squares that are not colored (i.e., `!square.userData.colored`) and collects them into an array. Then, it iterates over this array to remove each square from the grid. This approach avoids modifying the collection while it's being iterated, which should resolve the issue of some squares not being removed as expected.

Please note, modifying the original grid structure during iteration can lead to unexpected results, as mentioned. The solution provided here ensures that you're working with a static list of items to be removed, thus avoiding any iteration issues.
