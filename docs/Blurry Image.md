If the images loaded into your Three.js PlaneGeometry are appearing blurry, there are a few potential causes and solutions you can try:

1. Image resolution: Check the resolution of your images. If they have a low resolution, they might appear blurry when stretched across the PlaneGeometry. Try using higher-resolution images that match the size of the PlaneGeometry.

2. Texture filtering: Adjust the texture filtering settings to improve image quality. By default, Three.js uses bilinear filtering, which can cause blurriness when scaling images. You can try changing the filtering mode to achieve better results. For example, you can use THREE.NearestFilter for pixelated results or THREE.LinearFilter for smoother results. Here's an example of how to set the filtering mode:

```javascript
const texture = new THREE.TextureLoader().load('path/to/image.jpg');
texture.magFilter = THREE.LinearFilter; // Adjust the filtering mode
texture.minFilter = THREE.LinearMipmapLinearFilter; // Adjust the filtering mode
```

Experiment with different filter options to find the one that suits your needs.

3. Adjusting texture repeat: If your PlaneGeometry is larger than the image dimensions, the image will repeat or stretch across the geometry. This can cause blurriness. Ensure that the dimensions of your PlaneGeometry match the image size or adjust the texture repeat behavior. You can use the `repeat` property of the texture to control how the image is mapped onto the geometry:

```javascript
texture.repeat.set(1, 1); // Set repeat values according to your needs
```

4. Render settings: If your scene has antialiasing disabled, it can lead to visual artifacts and make the image appear blurry. Ensure that you have antialiasing enabled in your renderer configuration:

```javascript
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });
```

5. High-resolution display: If you're viewing your application on a high-resolution display, the blurriness might be an artifact of the display scaling. In such cases, you can try adjusting the pixel ratio to enhance the sharpness:

```javascript
renderer.setPixelRatio(window.devicePixelRatio || 1);
```

Experiment with different pixel ratios to achieve the desired result.

By addressing these potential causes and adjusting the relevant settings, you should be able to improve the image quality and reduce blurriness in your Three.js application.
