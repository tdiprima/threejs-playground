## Leaflet & Three.js Integration

<span style="color:#0000dd;">Please show me a working example of how to add a building in three.js to a map made by leaflet.js</span>

Sure, I can help guide you through a basic example of how to integrate a 3D model (e.g., a building) created in Three.js into a map created with Leaflet.js. We'll need to use the Leaflet's functionality to create a custom layer where our Three.js scene will be rendered.

Please note that this is a simplistic example and real-world scenarios might require more fine-tuning and dealing with the complexities of both libraries.

First, let's create the Leaflet map:

```javascript
// Create leaflet map
let map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);

L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
    maxZoom: 19,
}).addTo(map);
```

In this example, the map is centered on the coordinates (51.505, -0.09), which is roughly in the center of London, and OpenStreetMap is used for the tiles.

Next, let's create a custom layer for our Three.js scene:

```javascript
// Create custom layer
let ThreeLayer = L.Layer.extend({

    onAdd: function(map) {
        this.map = map;
        let size = this.map.getSize();

        // Create a new WebGL renderer and append it to the Leaflet's overlay pane
        this.renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
        this.renderer.setSize(size.x, size.y);
        this.renderer.domElement.style.position = 'absolute';
        this.renderer.domElement.style.top = 0;
        this.renderer.domElement.style.left = 0;
        let panes = this.map.getPanes();
        panes.overlayPane.appendChild(this.renderer.domElement);

        // Create the Three.js scene and camera
        this.scene = new THREE.Scene();
        this.camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(60, size.x / size.y, 1, 100000);
        this.camera.position.z = 500;
    },

    getEvents: function() {
        return {
            viewreset: this.onViewReset
        };
    },

    onViewReset: function() {
        this.render();
    },

    render: function() {
        this.renderer.render(this.scene, this.camera);
    }
});
```

In this code, we are creating a new WebGL renderer and appending it to the Leaflet's overlay pane. We are also creating a new Three.js scene and a perspective camera.

Now, let's add our custom layer to the map:

```javascript
// Add custom layer to map
let threeLayer = new ThreeLayer();
threeLayer.addTo(map);
```

Finally, let's add a 3D model (a box) to our scene:

```javascript
// Add a building
let geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(200, 200, 200);
let material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0x00ff00});
let cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
threeLayer.scene.add(cube);

// Update cube position to correspond to map location
let position = map.latLngToLayerPoint(new L.LatLng(51.505, -0.09));
cube.position.set(position.x, position.y, 0);

threeLayer.render();
```

In this last piece of code, we're creating a cube and adding it to our scene. Then, we convert the LatLng coordinates to layer points and set the cube's position.

Keep in mind that there is more work to be done to keep the 3D object positioned correctly when the map is panned or zoomed, and to possibly consider the map's current scale when determining the size of the 3D object.

In more complex scenarios, you might want to use GIS data to create your 3D buildings or load 3D models using Three.js loaders. This will also involve converting geographic coordinates to the Cartesian coordinates used by Three.js.

## Revision?

The code example provided doesn't rely on specific versions of Leaflet.js or Three.js. The basic principles applied should work for most recent versions of both libraries. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021:

- The latest version of Leaflet.js was 1.7.1, released in August 2020.
- The latest version of Three.js was r131, released in September 2021.
- <span style="color:#ff00cc;">There is no r131 in CDN, tho.</span>

Remember that as with any third-party library, it's good practice to check the documentation for the version you are using, as APIs can change over time.

## Error

Of course.

<span style="color:#0000dd;">There's no map or cube.  All I see is a white screen.  Is there something else I need to do to render this?</span>

I'm sorry for the confusion. The above code snippets are fragments for using Three.js and Leaflet.js together. They're not intended to be a complete, ready-to-run application.

Here is a more complete example that should run in a web page, as long as you are including the necessary JavaScript libraries. Be sure to replace `[PATH_TO_LEAFLET_CSS]`, `[PATH_TO_LEAFLET_JS]` and `[PATH_TO_THREE_JS]` with the correct paths to the respective CSS and JS files.

                let material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0x00ff00});
                this.cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
                this.scene.add(this.cube);

                this.animate();
            },

            animate: function() {
                // Update Three.js scene
                this.cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
                this.cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
                this.renderer.render(this.scene, this.camera);

                // Next frame
                requestAnimationFrame(this.animate.bind(this));
            }
        });

        // Add ThreeLayer to the map
        let threeLayer = new ThreeLayer();
        threeLayer.addTo(map);
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This example creates a spinning cube on top of the Leaflet map. Remember, this is a simplified example and the cube will not stay in place when the map is panned or zoomed. Adding that functionality requires additional work.
