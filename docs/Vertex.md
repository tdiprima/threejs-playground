## Select a vertex

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">Can the delete button be positioned near one of the mesh's vertices?</span>

Yes, you can position the delete button near one of the mesh's vertices in 3D space by first projecting that vertex's position to 2D screen space. This involves selecting a vertex from the mesh, converting its position from world coordinates to screen coordinates, and then using these screen coordinates to place the HTML button.

Here's how you can do it:

1. **Select a Vertex**: Choose a vertex of the mesh that you want to use for positioning the button. If the mesh is a `THREE.Geometry`, you can access vertices directly via `mesh.geometry.vertices`. For `THREE.BufferGeometry`, it's a bit more complex as vertices are stored in buffer attributes.

2. **Convert Vertex Position to World Space**: If the mesh has been transformed (translated, rotated, scaled), you need to apply these transformations to the vertex position.

3. **Project to Screen Space**: Use the camera to project this world-space position to normalized device coordinate (NDC) space, and then convert NDC to screen space.

4. **Position the Button**: Use the calculated screen space coordinates to position the HTML button.

Here's an example assuming your mesh uses `BufferGeometry` and you want to position the button near the first vertex of the mesh:

<span style="color:#59acf3;font-size:larger;">edit.js</span>

```javascript
// Assuming mesh, camera, and renderer are already defined
const vertex = new THREE.Vector3();
// Extract the first vertex position from the geometry
vertex.fromBufferAttribute(mesh.geometry.attributes.position, 0); // For the first vertex

// Convert the vertex position to world space
vertex.applyMatrix4(mesh.matrixWorld);

// Project this world space position to normalized device coordinates (NDC)
vertex.project(camera);

// Convert NDC to screen space
const x = (vertex.x *  .5 + .5) * renderer.domElement.clientWidth;
const y = (vertex.y * -.5 + .5) * renderer.domElement.clientHeight;

// Create and position the button
const button = document.createElement('button');
button.textContent = 'Delete Mesh';
document.body.appendChild(button);
button.style.position = 'absolute';
button.style.left = `${x}px`;
button.style.top = `${y}px`;
button.style.transform = 'translate(-50%, -50%)'; // Center the button over the vertex

// Add event listener for the button
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  scene.remove(mesh); // Remove mesh from scene
  document.body.removeChild(button); // Remove the button
  // Optionally, re-render the scene if not using an animation loop
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
});
```

This code positions a delete button near the first vertex of the mesh. Adjust the vertex selection (`fromBufferAttribute(mesh.geometry.attributes.position, 0)`) as needed if you prefer a different vertex for positioning the button.

## Offset

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">If I want to position the delete button not on top of the vertex, but 10 pixels away from it...</span>

To position the delete button 10 pixels away from the vertex, you can adjust the final screen space coordinates before setting the button's position. You'll decide the direction in which to offset the button. A simple approach is to offset diagonally, but you can choose any direction you prefer.

Given the screen space coordinates (`x`, `y`) calculated from the vertex's position, you can simply add or subtract the desired pixel offset to these coordinates. Here's how you could modify the previous example to achieve this:

```javascript
// Convert NDC to screen space and adjust for a 10 pixel offset
const xOffset = 10; // 10 pixels right
const yOffset = -10; // 10 pixels up (screen coordinates are y-down)
const x = (vertex.x *  .5 + .5) * renderer.domElement.clientWidth + xOffset;
const y = (vertex.y * -.5 + .5) * renderer.domElement.clientHeight + yOffset;
```

This adjustment positions the button 10 pixels to the right and 10 pixels up from the vertex's projected screen position. You can modify the `xOffset` and `yOffset` values to change the direction and distance of the offset as needed. For instance, if you want the button to be positioned directly to the right of the vertex, you might only adjust the `x` value and leave `y` unchanged.

This approach allows you to control the positioning of the button relative to the vertex precisely, making it possible to place the button in a <mark>**visually clear and non-obstructive location**</mark> in relation to the mesh's geometry on the screen.

## Error-trapping for matrix world

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">Sometimes it complains that mesh.matrixWorld has no parent or something.  How can I error-trap, and yet still have this work?</span>

To handle the situation where `mesh.matrixWorld` might not have a parent or another related issue, you can add a check to ensure `mesh.matrixWorld` is valid and has been updated correctly.

You can use `mesh.updateMatrixWorld(true)` to force the update of `mesh.matrixWorld` and its ancestors if necessary. Here's how you can integrate this with error handling:

```javascript
try {
  // Ensure the mesh's world matrix is up to date
  mesh.updateMatrixWorld(true);

  const vertex = new THREE.Vector3();
  vertex.fromBufferAttribute(mesh.geometry.attributes.position, 0); // For the first vertex

  // Apply the world matrix to the vertex
  vertex.applyMatrix4(mesh.matrixWorld);

  vertex.project(camera);

  const x = (vertex.x * 0.5 + 0.5) * renderer.domElement.clientWidth;
  const y = (vertex.y * -0.5 + 0.5) * renderer.domElement.clientHeight;
  
  // Proceed with using x and y as needed
} catch (error) {
  console.error('An error occurred:', error.message);
  // Handle the error, e.g., by skipping this vertex or providing fallback logic
}
```

This approach ensures that any errors during the matrix application or projection process are caught, allowing you to handle them appropriately (e.g., logging the error, using fallback values, or skipping the current operation). The `try...catch` block helps in managing unexpected errors, preventing the entire script from failing due to issues with a single mesh or vertex operation.
