## Avoid Clipping in Three.js

Original setup:

```js
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(90, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, -10, 100);
camera.position.set(0, 0, 150000);
//camera.position.set(0, 0, 1250);
```

My setup:

```js
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(90, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 12000);
camera.position.set(0, 0, 11000);
camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0));
scene.add(camera);
```

When you're dealing with a huge image in Three.js and encountering clipping issues as you describe, it's often a matter of adjusting both the camera's far plane and possibly its near plane, as well as looking into how you're using `TrackballControls`. The fact that the image gets cut off when turning it sideways but appears fine when zoomed in close suggests that the issue is related to the camera's frustum not encompassing the entire image when viewed from certain angles. Here's a simplified way to tackle this problem, aiming to cheer you up with some straightforward fixes!

### 1. Adjust the Camera's Far Plane

You've already set your camera's far plane to 12000, which seems sufficient for the distance you're viewing the image from. However, if the image still gets cut off, consider whether:

- The image or parts of it extend beyond this distance when rotated. If so, you might need to increase the far plane even more, though doing so can impact performance and depth precision.
- The near plane at `0.1` could be causing precision issues for very large scenes. Adjusting it slightly higher might help, but only if objects aren't expected to be very close to the camera.

### 2. Review TrackballControls Settings

`TrackballControls` can affect how the camera views objects, especially in terms of how it orbits around them and how zooming is handled. Check the following:

- **DynamicDampingFactor**: Controls how quickly the camera settles after you stop moving it. A lower value can make movements more abrupt, which might not be ideal for very large images.
- **MaxDistance**: This limits how far out you can zoom. Ensuring it's not set too low can prevent clipping when the camera is moved back.
- **RotateSpeed**: Adjusting this might help with how quickly and smoothly you can rotate the camera, potentially reducing the disorienting effect of parts of the image disappearing.

### 3. Consider the Camera Position and Target

When rotating the image, if you're losing sight of parts of it, it's worth considering the camera's initial position and the point it's looking at (its target). Sometimes, adjusting these can prevent the issue:

- Ensure the camera is positioned to see the entirety of the image, or at least its critical parts, without needing to be too far away.
- Use `camera.lookAt(x, y, z);` to focus the camera on the center or a specific part of the image, which might help keep it in view during rotation.

### 4. Check the Geometry and Material

Sometimes, the issue might not be with the camera or controls but with how the image (as a texture on a geometry) interacts with lighting or how its material properties are set. Ensure that:

- The material's side property is set to `THREE.DoubleSide` if you need to view the image from both sides.
- The geometry is large enough and positioned correctly to fully display the image without parts going beyond the camera's view frustum.

### Final Note

Adjusting these aspects should help avoid the clipping issue while maintaining a pleasant user experience. If adjustments to the camera and controls don't solve the problem, it might be worth reviewing the scene setup to ensure the image and camera are optimally positioned relative to each other. Three.js offers a lot of flexibility, so there's usually a way to get the visual results you're aiming for, even with very large images. Keep experimenting, and you'll find the right balance!

## Camera

For your specific case where you're displaying a very large image and experiencing issues with it being cut off when rotated, you might need to adjust both the near and far plane values of your camera to better accommodate the size of your image and the distances involved. Since you're already using a far plane of 12000, let's focus on fine-tuning your camera setup to ensure the entire image can be viewed without clipping, no matter the orientation.

Given your setup, here are some specific recommendations:

### Camera Setup

- **Far Plane**: You've set this to 12000, which seems sufficient for your needs. However, if you find that parts of the image are still getting cut off due to the camera's frustum not encompassing the image at extreme angles, you might consider increasing this slightly. For example, try setting it to 15000 or even 20000. The key is to balance performance with visibility, as a very high far plane can decrease depth buffer precision, potentially leading to z-fighting (where two surfaces are so close together, the renderer can't decide which one is in front).
- **Near Plane**: Setting this too low (e.g., 0.1) can cause precision issues in the depth buffer, particularly in large scenes. Since you're working with a very large image and a camera position that's relatively far back, you can afford to increase this slightly without losing detail on close objects. Try adjusting it to 1 or even 5. This adjustment can help mitigate clipping issues and improve rendering precision for distant objects.
- **Field of View (FOV)**: The FOV of 90 degrees is quite wide and suitable for immersive experiences but can contribute to distortion at the edges of the viewport, which might exacerbate the clipping issue when rotating the image. Consider slightly reducing the FOV if the user's viewport can still capture the essential parts of the image. A FOV between 60 and 75 degrees might offer a good balance between visibility and minimal distortion.

### Example Configuration

```javascript
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 1, 20000);
camera.position.z = 11000; // Adjust based on your image's size and how it fits within the scene
```

### Using TrackballControls

Ensure your `TrackballControls` are configured to support smooth and unrestricted movement around the image:

- **Adjust `maxDistance`**: If you've increased the camera's far plane, also increase `TrackballControls`' `maxDistance` to allow zooming out far enough to see the entire image.
- **Fine-tune `dynamicDampingFactor`**: A value around 0.2 can offer a smooth yet responsive control feel.

### Final Tips

- After making these adjustments, test the interaction at various angles and distances to ensure the entire image remains visible without clipping.
- Consider the aspect ratio of your image and the viewport. Adjusting the camera's position and orientation to ensure the image is always within the camera's frustum is crucial for avoiding clipping.

By starting with these settings and then tweaking as necessary based on your specific image size and user interaction needs, you should be able to create a more reliable viewing experience that minimizes or eliminates the issue of the image being cut off when rotated.

## TrackballControls

If you haven't set the `maxDistance` for `TrackballControls` in your Three.js application, and you're dealing with very large images and distances, you'll want to configure `maxDistance` to a value that allows users to zoom out far enough to see the entire image without it getting cut off, but not so far that they lose a sense of scale or detail. The ideal `maxDistance` value can depend on the size of your scene and how you want the user to interact with it.

Given your camera's far plane is set to 12000 (and considering adjusting it up to 20000 as previously suggested), you'll want your `maxDistance` to be less than or equal to your camera's far plane to prevent the camera from zooming out beyond the point where it can render the scene effectively.

### Suggested maxDistance Value

A good starting point for `maxDistance` would be slightly less than your camera's far plane to ensure that the user can zoom out to see the entire image but still maintains a reasonable rendering distance. If your far plane is at 20000, setting `maxDistance` to somewhere between 15000 and 18000 might work well. This gives you a buffer that ensures the image can be fully viewed without clipping or losing too much detail from being too far away.

### Example Configuration

Assuming you adjust your camera's far plane to 20000, you could set up your `TrackballControls` like this:

```javascript
// Assuming `camera` and `renderer.domElement` are already defined
const controls = new THREE.TrackballControls(camera, renderer.domElement);

// Configure controls to suit the scene
controls.maxDistance = 18000; // Allows for a wide zoom out to see the entire image
```

### Adjusting Based on Testing

It's important to test this value in your actual application. The correct setting can vary significantly based on your specific needs, such as the size of the image you're displaying, the typical viewport size of your users, and the desired user experience. If you find that the entire image can't be comfortably viewed at this `maxDistance`, consider increasing it. Conversely, if you want to keep the user closer to the image for detail work, you might lower it.

Testing with different viewport sizes and device types (if applicable) will help ensure that your chosen `maxDistance` provides a good user experience across all the ways your application can be used.
