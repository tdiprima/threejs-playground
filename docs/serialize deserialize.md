## Serialize and Deserialize Canvas

In fabric.js, we can serialize and deserialize our canvas, in order to save it to a database and restore it.  Can we do the same in three.js?  I have a fabric.js code sample below; can it be converted to three.js?

```javascript
let canvas = new fabric.Canvas('c');
canvas.add(new fabric.Rect({
  width: 50,
  height: 50,
  fill: 'red',
  top: 100,
  left: 100
}));
let c = canvas.toJSON();

console.log('%ccanvas to json', 'color: lime;', c);
console.log('%ctype', 'color: blue;', typeof c);

let str = JSON.stringify(canvas);
console.log('%cstr', 'color: red;', str);

canvas.clear();
canvas.loadFromJSON(c);
```

### Objects' Necessary Properties

In Three.js, there isn't a built-in serialization and deserialization functionality like in fabric.js. However, you can still achieve similar functionality by manually storing and restoring the necessary properties of objects in your scene.

Here's an example of how you could convert your fabric.js code sample to a basic Three.js equivalent:

```javascript
// Set up the scene
const scene = new THREE.Scene();

// Add a cube to the scene
// const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(50, 50, 50);
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 'red' });
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
// cube.position.set(100, 25, 0);
cube.position.set(2, 0.5, 0);
scene.add(cube);

// Serialize the scene
const serializedScene = JSON.stringify(scene.toJSON());

console.log('%cscene to json', 'color: lime;', serializedScene);
console.log('%ctype', 'color: blue;', typeof serializedScene);

// Restore the scene
scene.clear();
const parsedScene = JSON.parse(serializedScene);
const loader = new THREE.ObjectLoader();
const restoredObjects = loader.parse(parsedScene);
scene.add(restoredObjects);
```

In this example, we manually create a scene, add a cube to it, and then serialize the scene using `JSON.stringify(scene.toJSON())`. To restore the scene, we parse the serialized JSON, create a `THREE.ObjectLoader` to load the parsed objects, and add them back to the scene.

Note that this is a basic example and may not cover all possible scenarios. You may need to adapt and customize the serialization and deserialization process based on the specific objects and properties you're using in your Three.js scene.

## Position Update Not Working

<span style="color:#0000dd;">It's because I'm reserializing &ndash; see below.</span>

Using the Three.js library for rendering 3D graphics. In your code, you are correctly setting the position of the cube using `cube.position.set(2, 0.5, 0)`. However, the `needsUpdate` property does not affect the position of the mesh. It is used for notifying Three.js that certain attributes of the geometry or material have been updated and need to be reprocessed.

To update the position of the cube, you don't need to set `needsUpdate` to `true`. Instead, make sure that you are using the correct scene and renderer setup, and that the cube is being added to the scene properly.

## Aha! Position not saved

If you're serializing and deserializing the scene using `scene.toJSON()`, you're correct that the position information of the mesh won't be included in the resulting JSON data. The `toJSON()` method of Three.js excludes certain properties, including the position, rotation, and scale of objects.

If you need to store and restore the positions of objects in your scene, you have a couple of options:

1. **Serialize/Deserialize Additional Data:** You can manually collect the position information of each mesh in the scene and include it as part of your serialized data. When deserializing, you can set the positions of the meshes based on the restored position data. Here's an example:

   ```javascript
   // Serializing
   let serializedData = {
     meshes: []
   };

   scene.traverse((object) => {
     if (object instanceof THREE.Mesh) {
       serializedData.meshes.push({
         position: object.position.toArray()
         // Include other necessary properties
       });
     }
   });

   let jsonString = JSON.stringify(serializedData);

   // Storing jsonString to the database

   // Deserializing
   let restoredData = JSON.parse(jsonString);

   restoredData.meshes.forEach((meshData) => {
     let mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
     mesh.position.fromArray(meshData.position);
     // Set other necessary properties

     scene.add(mesh);
   });
   ```

   In this approach, you collect the positions (and other necessary properties) of the meshes in the scene and include them in your serialized data. During deserialization, you create new mesh objects and set their positions based on the restored data.

2. **Use a Custom Serialization Approach:** Instead of relying on the `toJSON()` method, you can implement a custom serialization approach where you explicitly include the position information in the serialized data. This gives you more control over what properties are included in the serialization process.

   ```javascript
   // Serializing
   let serializedData = {
     meshes: []
   };

   scene.traverse((object) => {
     if (object instanceof THREE.Mesh) {
       serializedData.meshes.push({
         position: object.position.toArray()
         // Include other necessary properties
       });
     }
   });

   let jsonString = JSON.stringify(serializedData);

   // Storing jsonString to the database

   // Deserializing
   let restoredData = JSON.parse(jsonString);

   restoredData.meshes.forEach((meshData) => {
     let mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
     mesh.position.fromArray(meshData.position);
     // Set other necessary properties

     scene.add(mesh);
   });
   ```

   This approach is similar to the first one, but **you have more control over which properties to include** in the serialization process. You can manually define the structure of the serialized data and ensure that the position information is included.

Both approaches have their pros and cons, so you can choose the one that best fits your requirements and the complexity of your scene.
