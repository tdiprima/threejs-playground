## Reset Trackball Controls

qwen1.5-72b-chat

In Three.js, if you're using TrackballControls, you can reset the camera to its center position by calling the reset() method of the controls object.

Typically, you might want to call this method after the user completes an action, such as clicking a button. For example:

```js
document.getElementById('resetButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
  controls.reset();
});
```

This didn't straighten it out as I wanted, and GPT-4 - same thing. But they're on the right track.

```js
button.addEventListener("click", function() {
  camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0);
  camera.position.x = 0;
  camera.position.y = 0;
});
```

To center the camera using Trackball Controls in Three.js, you need to reset both the camera position and the Trackball Controls' target. The `camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0);` part is correct for aiming the camera at the center of the scene, but you also need to explicitly reset the Trackball Controls to reflect this new orientation and position.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Reset the camera position to where you want it. If you want it centered, you might want to move it back a bit on the Z axis so it's not inside your object.
2. Update the Trackball Controls to ensure the internal state is consistent with the camera's new position and orientation.

Here's a short code snippet:

```javascript
button.addEventListener("click", function () {
    // Set the camera position
    camera.position.set(0, 0, 100); // Adjust 100 to whatever suits your scene
    camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0); // Look at the center of the scene

    // Assuming your Trackball Controls variable is named 'controls'
    controls.target.set(0, 0, 0); // Reset the target to the center
    controls.update(); // Important to call this to update the internal state
});
```

Make sure that `controls` is the variable holding your Trackball Controls instance, and adjust the camera's Z position (`100` in this example) to fit your scene's scale and preferred viewing distance.
