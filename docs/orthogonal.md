## Orthogonal

"Orthogonal" is a term that originally comes from geometry, but it's used in various fields like math, computer science, and everyday life. To understand it easily, let's break it down:

Imagine you're standing in a room, facing one wall. Now, think about the floor. The floor and the wall meet at a corner, right? The way the floor is positioned in relation to the wall is what we call "orthogonal." In simpler terms, it means **"at right angles"** or **"perpendicular."** So, when two things are orthogonal, they meet or cross each other at a 90-degree angle, just like the floor and the wall in your room.

This concept isn't just about physical objects. It can be used to describe ideas, features, or situations that are **independent or unrelated** to each other. For example, in computer science, if two features of a system are orthogonal, changing one feature doesn't affect the other. They are sort of like separate paths that don't interfere with each other.

So, when someone uses "orthogonal" in a sentence, they're often talking about things that are either perpendicular to each other, like lines or surfaces, or they're talking about concepts or aspects that are independent of each other.

### Example

"Her approach to solving the problem was orthogonal to mine; while I focused on analyzing historical data, she concentrated on predicting future trends, showing how two different strategies can provide unique insights into the same issue."

*PaintPolygon and Leaflet are not orthogonal; they are tightly coupled.*

## Evolution of Word "Orthogonal"

The journey from "orthogonal" meaning "at right angles" to its metaphorical use in describing concepts or ideas as independent or unrelated is quite interesting and is a great example of how language evolves and expands in meaning.

1. **Original Meaning - Geometric Origins**: The word "orthogonal" comes from the Greek words "orthos," meaning "right" or "straight," and "gonia," meaning "angle." So, its original and literal meaning is related to right angles. In geometry, two lines or planes are orthogonal if they meet at a right angle, implying a very specific and clear relationship.

2. **Metaphorical Leap - From Space to Ideas**: The leap from this geometric concept to its use in describing ideas or concepts is metaphorical. In geometry, two lines that are orthogonal don't influence each other's direction; they are independent. This notion of independence is key to its metaphorical use. When we say two topics or concepts are orthogonal, we mean they are as independent from each other as two lines at a right angle. They don't intersect or influence each other in a meaningful way. ðŸ’¡ðŸ¥´

3. **Expansion in Various Fields**: This metaphorical use of "orthogonal" has been embraced in various fields. In statistics, for instance, orthogonal variables are uncorrelated. In computer science or business, orthogonal strategies or considerations might operate independently from one another, allowing for separate development or discussion without interference.

4. **Linguistic Evolution**: This evolution of "orthogonal" from a strict geometric term to a metaphor for independence in ideas illustrates how language can evolve. A concept from one field (geometry) provides a useful way to express a concept in another field (independence of ideas or strategies).

In summary, the transition from "right angles" to "independent ideas" in the use of "orthogonal" is a metaphorical extension. It's a linguistic evolution where a clear, visual concept from geometry is used to effectively describe a more abstract relationship in various other fields. This kind of evolution is common in language, where concrete terms are often used to express more abstract ideas.
