## Delaying rendering after the user stops scrolling

<span style="color:#051094;">OpenSeadragon will hesitate rendering a whole slide image until the user has stopped scrolling.  Is there a way to mimic such hesitation in three.js?</span>

Yes, it is possible to mimic the hesitation behavior of OpenSeadragon in three.js.

OpenSeadragon is a popular JavaScript library used for displaying high-resolution images, such as whole slide images, and it includes a feature called <mark>**"spring-natural scrolling"**</mark> that causes the image to continue moving after the user stops scrolling.

This can help **prevent the image from rendering too quickly**, which can be especially important when working with large, high-resolution images.

In three.js, you can mimic this hesitation behavior by using a similar technique, such as **adding a delay** before rendering the image after the user stops scrolling.

One way to achieve this is by using the `setTimeout` function to wait for a specified period of time before rendering the image. 

For example, you could add an **event listener** to the **scroll** event of the window, and then use `setTimeout` to wait for a certain amount of time before rendering the image.

```javascript
var timeout = null;

function onScroll() {
  clearTimeout(timeout);
  timeout = setTimeout(renderImage, 500); // Wait 500ms before rendering
}

function renderImage() {
  // Render the image here
}

window.addEventListener('scroll', onScroll);
```

<br>

In this example, the `onScroll` function is called every time the user scrolls the window, and it uses `setTimeout` to wait for 500ms before calling the `renderImage` function.

**If the user continues scrolling** during this time, the `timeout` variable is cleared and the delay is reset. Once the delay has passed without any further scrolling, the `renderImage` function is called to render the image.

Overall, while three.js does not have a built-in feature for hesitating rendering like OpenSeadragon, it is possible to achieve a similar effect using techniques like delaying rendering after the user stops scrolling.


## How to display a whole slide image in three.js

To display a whole slide image in Three.js, you can use a texture and apply it to a plane geometry.

```javascript
// create a texture loader
var loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();

// load the image as a texture
var texture = loader.load('path/to/image.jpg');

// Assuming that the image has a 1:1 aspect ratio
var geometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(1, texture.image.height / texture.image.width);

// create a material using the texture
var material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: texture });

// create a mesh with the geometry and material
var mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);

// add the mesh to the scene
scene.add(mesh);
```

<br>

TODO: Create a plane geometry with the **same aspect ratio** as the image. Adjust the `PlaneGeometry` accordingly.

## three.js cannot handle SVS files

A digital slide image file created by an Aperio ScanScope slide scanner.

Yes, you are correct. Three.js does not have built-in support for SVS files, and therefore cannot directly load and display them.

However, there are third-party libraries available that can **convert SVS files** to more common image formats, such as JPEG or PNG, that can be loaded by Three.js.

One such library is **OpenSlide**, which provides a C library and command-line tools for reading and converting various whole-slide image formats, including SVS.

1. Install OpenSlide on your system. **`brew install openslide`**

2. Use the `openslide-write-png` command-line tool to **convert** the SVS file to a PNG file:

    ```sh
    openslide-write-png input.svs x y level width height output.png
    ```

    This will create a PNG file named `output.png` that contains the contents of the SVS file.

3. Load the PNG file in Three.js using the `TextureLoader`:

```javascript
var loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();

loader.load('output.png', function(texture) {
  var geometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(1, 1);
  var material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: texture });
  var mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
  scene.add(mesh);
});
```

### Pre-processing <span style="font-size:30px;">üî•üßØüßëüèª‚Äçüöí</span>

Note that this approach requires you to pre-process the SVS file before it can be displayed in Three.js, which may be a **time-consuming** task depending on the size of the file. 

Additionally, the resulting PNG file may be quite large and consume a lot of memory, which can **impact the performance** of your application.


## Get dimensions of whole slide image

```python
# pip install openslide-python
import openslide

# Open the slide file
slide = openslide.OpenSlide('path/to/slide.svs')

# Get the dimensions of the largest level
width, height = slide.level_dimensions[0]

print(f"Slide dimensions: {width} x {height}")

# Close the slide
slide.close()
```

<br>

This will open the slide file using OpenSlide, and then retrieve the dimensions of the largest level of the slide using the `level_dimensions` property. The dimensions are returned as a tuple containing the width and height of the level, respectively.

To convert the slide to PNG format, you can use the `openslide-write-png` command-line tool.

```sh
openslide-write-png slide x y level width height output.png
```

How to convert the largest level of the slide to PNG format:

```sh
openslide-write-png path/to/slide.svs 0 0 0 <width> <height> output.png

openslide-write-png input.svs 0 0 0 112319 87197 output.png  # took too long
# I divided the height by the width, and multiplied it by 1024 (the width that I wanted) to get the height
# I divided the size by 2 so I can get good x,y coordinates
openslide-write-png input.svs 56159 43598 0 1024 794 output.png
```

Replace `<width>` and `<height>` with the values retrieved from the openslide get `level_dimensions` function. This will create a PNG file named `output.png` in the current directory that contains the contents of the slide.

Once you have the PNG file, you can load it into Three.js using the `TextureLoader` and display it using a `PlaneGeometry` and `MeshBasicMaterial`, as explained previously.

## Re. Size. Aspect ratio...

How to resize an image to a width of 1024 pixels and calculate the corresponding height:

```python
from PIL import Image

# Open the PNG file
image = Image.open('output.png')

# Get the original width and height
width, height = image.size

# Calculate the new height based on the desired width and aspect ratio
new_width = 1024
new_height = int(height * (new_width / width))

# Resize the image
resized_image = image.resize((new_width, new_height))

# Save the resized image as a PNG file
resized_image.save('resized_output.png')

# Close the original and resized images
image.close()
resized_image.close()
```

<br>

Note that when resizing the image, the **aspect ratio** of the original image is maintained, so the height of the resized image is **calculated proportionally** to the desired width.
