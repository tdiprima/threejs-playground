## Polynomial

In math, a polynomial is a kind of equation that involves only powers of variables and coefficients. For example, something like \(3x^2 + 4x + 5\) is a polynomial. Here, *x* is a variable, and it's raised to different powers &mdash; like 2 in x^2 &mdash; and there are numbers multiplied with these *x* terms (these numbers are called coefficients).

Now, when someone says they want to do something "polynomially," in a computing or algorithm context, it usually means they want to <mark>**do it in a way that's efficient and doesn't take too long, even as the problem they're solving gets bigger.**</mark>

In the context of your example sentence: "I know how to draw circles. I only need an algorithm that will help me to put those circles [polynomially](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16118553/drawing-a-polygon-with-circles-using-java-script-canvas)."

It sounds like you're saying you know how to draw circles, but you need a method (or algorithm) to arrange or position these circles in a way that is **efficient.** This means that even if you have to position a lot of circles, the method shouldn't become too slow or too hard to handle.

In simpler terms, "polynomially" here is like saying, "I want to position these circles in a smart and practical way, so even if I have many circles, it won't become too tough or time-consuming to figure out where to put them."
