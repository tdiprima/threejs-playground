## Convert to three.js

<span style="color:#000088;">I have an application that uses OpenSeadragon to zoom in and out of images.  It also uses fabric.js to draw on images and annotate.  It also can display 4 transparent images, and uses the OpenSeadragon filtering plugin, along with html control-elements, to colorize each layer.  Is it possible to convert this, such that it uses only three.js instead?</span>

Yes, it is possible to convert your application to use Three.js instead of OpenSeadragon and fabric.js. Three.js is a powerful JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics and animations in the browser, and it can also be used for 2D graphics and image manipulation.

To achieve similar functionality with Three.js, you would need to implement the following:

1. **Image Zooming:** Three.js doesn't have built-in support for image zooming like OpenSeadragon, but you can achieve zooming effects by manipulating the camera and adjusting the scale of the objects in the scene.

2. **Image Drawing and Annotation:** Three.js provides various geometries and materials for rendering objects, including textures that can be mapped onto geometries. You can create a canvas element and use it as a texture to draw and annotate images. You would need to handle user interactions like mouse events to draw and interact with the canvas.

3. **Layering and Filtering:** Three.js supports layering objects by rendering them with different materials or using multiple scenes. You can create transparent materials for your images and control their visibility and blending modes. For colorization, you can use shaders to apply filters and adjust the appearance of the images.

Converting your application to Three.js would involve rewriting and restructuring the code to work with Three.js APIs. It may require significant changes depending on the complexity of your existing code. You'll need to familiarize yourself with the Three.js documentation and learn how to create and manipulate scenes, cameras, geometries, materials, textures, and shaders.

It's important to note that while Three.js is a powerful library for 3D graphics, it may introduce a higher learning curve compared to OpenSeadragon and fabric.js, especially if you're not familiar with 3D programming concepts.

## Layering and Filtering

Certainly! Here's a code example that demonstrates layering and filtering using Three.js:

```javascript
// Set up the scene, camera, and renderer
var scene = new THREE.Scene();
var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

// Create a base image
var baseTexture = new THREE.TextureLoader().load('path/to/baseImage.jpg');
var baseMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: baseTexture });
var baseGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(5, 5); // Adjust the size as needed
var baseMesh = new THREE.Mesh(baseGeometry, baseMaterial);
scene.add(baseMesh);

// Create a transparent image layer
var transparentTexture = new THREE.TextureLoader().load('path/to/transparentImage.png');
var transparentMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: transparentTexture, transparent: true, opacity: 0.5 });
var transparentGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(5, 5); // Adjust the size as needed
var transparentMesh = new THREE.Mesh(transparentGeometry, transparentMaterial);
scene.add(transparentMesh);

// Create a color filter
var filterColor = new THREE.Color(1, 0, 0); // Red color filter

// Create a custom shader material for colorization
var colorizationMaterial = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  uniforms: {
    texture: { value: transparentTexture },
    filterColor: { value: filterColor },
  },
  vertexShader: `
    varying vec2 vUv;
    void main() {
      vUv = uv;
      gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
    }
  `,
  fragmentShader: `
    uniform sampler2D texture;
    uniform vec3 filterColor;
    varying vec2 vUv;
    void main() {
      vec4 texel = texture2D(texture, vUv);
      texel.rgb *= filterColor;
      gl_FragColor = texel;
    }
  `
});

// Apply the colorization material to the transparent mesh
transparentMesh.material = colorizationMaterial;

// Set up the camera position and controls
camera.position.z = 10;
var controls = new THREE.OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement);

// Render the scene
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  controls.update();
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
animate();
```

In this example, we create a base image and a transparent image layer using `THREE.PlaneGeometry` and `THREE.MeshBasicMaterial`. The transparent material has the `transparent` property set to `true` and an `opacity` of `0.5` to make it semi-transparent.

To apply the color filter, we create a custom shader material (`THREE.ShaderMaterial`) that takes the transparent image texture and a filter color as uniforms. The vertex shader simply passes the texture coordinates, and the fragment shader applies the color filter to the texel color.

Finally, we set the colorization material as the material for the transparent mesh, and we render the scene using a combination of `requestAnimationFrame` and the `OrbitControls` for camera interaction.

You would need to replace the paths to the base image and transparent image with your own image paths. Feel free to adjust the sizes, positions, and other parameters as needed to fit your specific use case.

Note that this is a basic example to demonstrate the concept of layering and filtering with Three.js. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to modify and extend this code further.

## HTML?

The HTML part of the code for the vertex shader and fragment shader can be written using `<script>` tags in your HTML file. Here's an example of how you can include the shaders in your HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Layering and Filtering with Three.js</title>
  <style>
    body {
      margin: 0;
      overflow: hidden;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <script id="vertexShader" type="x-shader/x-vertex">
    varying vec2 vUv;
    void main() {
      vUv = uv;
      gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
    }
  </script>
  <script id="fragmentShader" type="x-shader/x-fragment">
    uniform sampler2D texture;
    uniform vec3 filterColor;
    varying vec2 vUv;
    void main() {
      vec4 texel = texture2D(texture, vUv);
      texel.rgb *= filterColor;
      gl_FragColor = texel;
    }
  </script>
  <script src="path/to/three.js"></script>
  <script src="path/to/orbitcontrols.js"></script>
  <script>
    // Your JavaScript code here
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In the above HTML code, the vertex shader is defined inside the `<script>` tag with the `id="vertexShader"` attribute and the type set to `"x-shader/x-vertex"`. Similarly, the fragment shader is defined inside the `<script>` tag with the `id="fragmentShader"` attribute and the type set to `"x-shader/x-fragment"`.

You should replace the `path/to/three.js` and `path/to/orbitcontrols.js` with the actual paths to the Three.js library and the OrbitControls script, respectively. Make sure you have included these dependencies before your custom JavaScript code.

You can then access the shaders in your JavaScript code by using `document.getElementById()` to retrieve the shader source code:

```javascript
// Get the vertex shader source code
var vertexShaderSource = document.getElementById('vertexShader').textContent;

// Get the fragment shader source code
var fragmentShaderSource = document.getElementById('fragmentShader').textContent;
```

By retrieving the shader source code using the `textContent` property, you can use it to create the shaders in Three.js using `THREE.ShaderMaterial`.

## Must have a compiled fragment shader attached

The code you provided looks correct, and it should work as expected. The error message "Must have a compiled fragment shader attached" typically occurs when there is an issue with the fragment shader code.

However, the error may not be related to the code you posted. It's possible that the error is caused by some other part of your application, or there may be an issue with the image paths you provided.

To troubleshoot the issue, you can try the following:

1. Verify that the **paths** to the base image (`baseImage.jpg`) and the transparent image (`transparentImage.png`) are correct. Make sure the images are accessible and in the specified locations.

2. Check if there are **any other error messages** in the console that could provide more information about the problem. Sometimes, there may be additional errors preceding the "Must have a compiled fragment shader attached" error that could help pinpoint the issue.

3. Try **simplifying** the code to isolate the problem. For example, you can comment out the section related to the transparent image and its material, and see if the error still occurs. If it does not, gradually add back the code until you identify the specific part causing the error.

4. Ensure that you have included the Three.js library correctly. Make sure the **path to the Three.js** library is correct and that it is loaded before your custom code.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify the cause of the error and resolve it. If the issue persists, please provide any additional error messages or relevant information from the console, and I'll be happy to assist you further.
