## Ellipse Segments and Vertices

<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">Why is it 64 segments?</span>

<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">Why are we adding 1 to segments and then multiplying by 3?</span>

```js
let segments = 64;
let vertices = new Float32Array((segments + 1) * 3);
geometry.setAttribute("position", new THREE.BufferAttribute(vertices, 3));
```

In Three.js, when creating geometrical shapes such as an ellipse, the `segments` parameter defines the number of segments used to construct the shape. Here's why 64 segments are used and why 1 is added to segments before multiplying by 3 to get `vertices`:

1. **64 Segments**: The choice of 64 segments for an ellipse is a balance between performance and visual smoothness. Fewer segments might make the ellipse look polygonal (less smooth), while more segments would make the ellipse smoother but at the cost of performance due to more vertices to process. 64 is a relatively common choice because it provides a good balance, making the ellipse appear smoothly curved without being too demanding on resources.

2. **(Segments + 1) * 3 Calculation for Vertices**:
   - **Segments + 1**: In 3D graphics, when creating a closed loop like an ellipse, you need to define the vertices that make up the shape. To create a closed loop, the last vertex must connect back to the first vertex. Therefore, you need an extra vertex to close the loop. That's why `segments + 1` is used. If you only used `segments`, you would end up with an open shape, as the last segment would not connect back to the first.
   - **Multiplying by 3**: Each vertex in a 3D space is defined by three coordinates: x, y, and z. So for each vertex, you need three values. By multiplying the number of vertices by 3, you allocate enough space for all the x, y, and z coordinates of each vertex in the ellipse.

The resulting `vertices` array is a flat array where every group of three values represents the x, y, and z coordinates of a vertex in the ellipse. This array is then used to set the "position" attribute of the geometry, defining the shape of the ellipse in 3D space.

## Update ellipse

<span style="font-weight:bold;color:blue;">Create ellipse from 2 points on the screen: startPoint and endPoint.</span>

```js
  let positions = ellipse.geometry.attributes.position.array;  let center = new THREE.Vector3().addVectors(startPoint, endPoint).multiplyScalar(0.5);  let radiusX = Math.abs(startPoint.x - endPoint.x) * 0.5;  let radiusY = Math.abs(startPoint.y - endPoint.y) * 0.5;  for (let i = 0; i <= segments; i++) {    let theta = (i / segments) * Math.PI * 2;    let x = center.x + Math.cos(theta) * radiusX;    let y = center.y + Math.sin(theta) * radiusY;    positions[i * 3] = x;    positions[i * 3 + 1] = y;    positions[i * 3 + 2] = 0;  }  ellipse.geometry.attributes.position.needsUpdate = true;
```

Sure, I'll explain the code in a simple way:

1. **Getting the Positions Array**: The code starts by getting the `positions` array from the ellipse's geometry. This array will hold the x, y, z coordinates of each point (or vertex) on the ellipse.

2. **Calculating the Center**: To draw an ellipse, you need to know where its center is. The code calculates the center by taking two points, `startPoint` and `endPoint`, adding them together, and then dividing by 2 (that's what `multiplyScalar(0.5)` does). Imagine finding the middle of a line drawn between two points; that's your center.

3. **Calculating RadiusX and RadiusY**: An ellipse has two radii - one for the width (radiusX) and one for the height (radiusY). The code calculates these by taking the difference in x and y coordinates between `startPoint` and `endPoint`, then dividing those differences by 2. It's like measuring how wide and how tall the ellipse should be.

4. **Drawing the Ellipse**: The `for` loop is where the ellipse is actually drawn. It goes around in a circle (that's what the `theta` calculation is doing) and calculates the x and y position for each point on the ellipse. It does this using the `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` functions, which are ways to calculate positions on a circle (or ellipse). The `radiusX` and `radiusY` are used to stretch the circle into an ellipse shape.

   - For each point (i), `theta` is the angle around the circle (from 0 to 360 degrees, but in radians, which is a different way of measuring angles).
   - The x position is calculated as `center.x + Math.cos(theta) * radiusX`. This means start at the center, go a certain distance in the direction given by `theta`, and stretch it out by `radiusX`.
   - The y position is similar, but uses `Math.sin` and `radiusY`.

5. **Setting Z Coordinate**: The z-coordinate is set to 0 because the ellipse is flat (not popping out or going into the screen).

6. **Updating the Positions in the Ellipse**: After calculating all the points, the code tells Three.js that the positions of the ellipse's points have changed (`needsUpdate = true`). This is like saying, "Hey, I've finished drawing the ellipse, take a look!"

So, in short, the code calculates where the center of the ellipse should be, how wide and tall it should be, and then goes around in a circle, calculating and placing each point on the ellipse based on these measurements. Once it's done, it tells Three.js to update the shape on the screen.
