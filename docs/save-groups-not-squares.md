<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">When I save colored squares, and then deserialize the scene, everything is fine.  But when I create then save more colored squares a second time, the second set of squares is put in the wrong location.  Is there anything about saving them separately from their group that throws off the position?</span>

```js
let serializedObjects = [];

function serializeScene(scene) {
  let processedObjects = new Set();

  function shouldProcess(obj) {
    return obj.name.includes("annotation") || (obj.userData && obj.userData.colored);
  }

  function serializeObject(obj) {
    processedObjects.add(obj.id);
    serializedObjects.push(obj.toJSON());
  }

  scene.traverse((obj) => {
    // Check if object should be processed and hasn't been processed yet
    if (!processedObjects.has(obj.id) && shouldProcess(obj)) {
      serializeObject(obj);
    }

    // Additional logic for Groups with relevant children
    if (obj.type === 'Group' && obj.children.some(shouldProcess)) {
      obj.children.forEach(child => {
        if (!processedObjects.has(child.id) && shouldProcess(child)) {
          serializeObject(child);
        }
      });
    }
  });

  // TODO: save serializedObjects to database
  console.log('Serialized Objects:', serializedObjects);
  alert('Scene serialized successfully. Check console for details.');
}
```

Saving colored squares separately from their group and then deserializing them can indeed result in the squares being positioned incorrectly. This issue arises due to the way positions are handled in hierarchical scene graphs, like those managed by three.js. Here's why the positioning might be off:

1. **Local vs. Global Position:** In a three.js scene graph, each object's position is stored relative to its parent (local position). When you serialize individual objects without their parent group, their positions are saved as if they were global (relative to the scene). However, upon deserialization, if these objects are added directly to the scene without the correct parent-child relationship being restored, their positions will be interpreted as global positions, not relative to any parent group they were originally part of.

2. **Lack of Parent Group Context:** If colored squares are saved without their parent group, any transformation (position, rotation, scale) applied to the parent group is not applied to the children upon deserialization. If the parent group had any transformations, the children's positions would be correct only in the context of being within that transformed group. When deserialized independently, they lose this context, and thus, appear in the wrong location.

3. **Solution - Maintain Hierarchy:** To ensure correct positioning, maintain the hierarchical relationship when serializing and deserializing objects. This can be done in a few ways:
   - **Serialize Whole Groups:** Instead of serializing individual objects, serialize the entire group they belong to. This preserves the relative positions and transformations.
   - **Adjust Positions Upon Deserialization:** If you must serialize objects individually, calculate their global positions when saving and then adjust their positions relative to their intended parent upon deserialization.
   - **Custom Serialization Data:** Include custom data in your serialization process that captures the object's parent or its relative position to the parent. Use this data to reconstruct the correct hierarchy when deserializing.

4. **Example Code Adjustment:** If adopting the first solution, ensure your serialization process accounts for parent-child relationships. If adjusting positions manually, you might need to implement additional logic to calculate and apply the correct local position based on the intended parent group's transformations.

By addressing these points, you should be able to ensure that your colored squares are deserialized at the correct locations, preserving the intended layout of your scene.

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">Is there a way to save the colored squares (obj.userData.colored), and the group it belongs to, but not save the non-colored squares?  Would that fix the problem?</span>

Yes, you can modify your serialization process to save both the colored squares (`obj.userData.colored`) and the group they belong to, while excluding non-colored squares. This approach can indeed fix the positioning problem by preserving the hierarchical relationships that determine the local positions of objects within groups. Here's how you can adjust your serialization and deserialization processes.

<span style="color:lime;font-size:larger;">Wrong. It still saves the blue squares. And it colored some of my red squares white.  So we tried it again.  It duplicated them, saved them in the wrong spot, etc.</span>
