## Rainbow Color Shader Explanation

Â¿QuÃ© es esto?

```glsl
// Ales_Inferno/slider_shader.html - Fragment Shader
uniform float uTime;
varying vec2 vUv;

void main() {
  vec3 color = vec3(0.0);
  float t = mod(uTime, 1.0);
  float hue = fract(t * 6.0);

  if (hue < 0.1667) {
    // red - magenta
    color = mix(vec3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0), vec3(1.0, 0.0, 1.0), hue * 6.0);
  } // blah blah blah...
  else {
    // yellow - red
    color = mix(vec3(1.0, 1.0, 0.0), vec3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0), (hue - 0.8333) * 6.0);
  }

  gl_FragColor = vec4(color, 1.0);
}
```

This shader code decides what colors to show on the screen.  It creates a gradient of rainbow colors over time.

### Breakdown:

1. **Uniform Variable `uTime`**
    * Think of `uTime` as a clock. It tells the shader how much time has passed.
    * It is expected to be passed to the shader from the application.

    ```glsl
    uniform float uTime;
    ```

2. **Varying Variable `vUv`**: 

   - `vUv` usually contains the texture coordinates, but isn't used in this code, so we can ignore it for now.

    ```glsl
    varying vec2 vUv;
    ```

3. **Main Function**: 

   - `color` starts as black (no color).

   - `t` is the time on the clock but cycles back to zero every second (using `mod` function).
        * It's computed as the remainder of uTime divided by 1.0, creating a repeating pattern every unit of time.

   - `hue` is like a wheel of colors, and `t` decides which color we are on at the moment.
       - It's computed by scaling t by 6.0 and taking the fractional part. This effectively maps the repeating pattern of t into a hue value in the range [0, 1).

   - The `if` and `else if` statements check where `hue` is on the color wheel and mix colors accordingly, creating a smooth transition between them. It's creating a rainbow effect that changes over time.

    - The `mix` function linearly interpolates between two colors based on the provided weight, computed based on the hue value.

4. **Output**: 

   - Finally, it tells the screen to show the mixed color with full brightness (that's the `vec4(color, 1.0)` part).

    ```glsl
    gl_FragColor = vec4(color, 1.0);
    ```

<!-- transparent vs. opaque -->

### Result:

- The shader will display colors that change, creating a rainbow effect that cycles every second. How this looks on your screen depends on how the shader is used in the larger program and game or application.

- Typically, you might see the colors applied across a surface, object, or screen, with the colors changing dynamically as time progresses. ðŸŒˆ

## If hue, then color

The first if statement checks if "hue" is less than 0.1667 (which is approximately **one-sixth** of the way through the rainbow).

```js
let x = 1 / 6;
let res = 0;

// Loop 5 times, print 6
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 0) {
    console.log(x.toFixed(4))
    res = x + x;
  } else {
    res = res + x;
  }
  console.log(res.toFixed(4));
}

// 0.1667
// 0.3333
// 0.5000
// 0.6667
// 0.8333
// 1.0000
```

Great question! The reason why the code multiplies the hue value by 6.0 instead of 7.0 is because the color spectrum (rainbow) is divided into six equal sections in this shader. Each section represents a range of hues that correspond to a specific color transition.

By multiplying the hue value by 6.0, the code ensures that the hue value is **scaled to fit** within the range of 0 to 6.

This allows the code to calculate the ratio of the hue within each section and smoothly transition between the colors.
