## Scale image to plane

To scale down the loaded image and display it on a PlaneGeometry with a specific size, you can adjust the scale of the plane's material. Here's an example of how you can achieve this using the Three.js library:

```javascript
// Assuming you have already created a scene, camera, and renderer

// Define the desired size for the plane
const planeWidth = 500;
const planeHeight = 300;

// Create the PlaneGeometry with the desired size
const planeGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(planeWidth, planeHeight);

// Create a TextureLoader instance
const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();

// Load the image texture
textureLoader.load('path/to/your/image.jpg', function(texture) {
  // Scale the texture to fit the desired plane size
  texture.wrapS = texture.wrapT = THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping;
  texture.repeat.set(1, 1);
  texture.magFilter = THREE.LinearFilter;
  texture.minFilter = THREE.LinearMipmapLinearFilter;

  // Create a material using the texture
  const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: texture });

  // Create the plane mesh with the geometry and material
  const plane = new THREE.Mesh(planeGeometry, material);

  // Add the plane to the scene
  scene.add(plane);
});
```

In this example, we first define the desired size for the plane using `planeWidth` and `planeHeight`. Then, we create a `PlaneGeometry` instance with the specified size.

Next, we create a `TextureLoader` instance and load the image texture using the `load` method. Inside the callback function, we can manipulate the loaded texture. In this case, we set the texture wrapping, filtering, and scaling properties to ensure it fits the desired plane size.

We then create a `MeshBasicMaterial` with the loaded texture and use it to create a plane mesh (`THREE.Mesh`) with the geometry and material. Finally, we add the plane to the scene.

By scaling the texture to fit the plane size, the image will be displayed at the specified dimensions (500 x 300 in this case).
