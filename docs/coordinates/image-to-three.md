<!-- How do I translate image coordinates to three.js coordinates? -->
<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">Given this code... and these coordinates to draw a triangle on the image, how would I translate the image coordinates to three.js coordinates?</span>

To translate image coordinates to Three.js coordinates and draw a triangle on a texture, you can follow these steps. The key is converting the 2D image coordinates, which are typically in pixels, to the normalized device coordinates (NDC) used by Three.js, ranging from -1 to 1 for both axes (x and y) in the 3D space.

1. Convert the 2D Coordinates to 3D Coordinates: You need to map the 2D coordinates to Three.js's 3D world coordinates. This involves normalizing the coordinates based on the image dimensions to fit within the -1 to 1 range (NDC).

Etc.

This example loads an image onto a texture applied to a plane and draws a triangle on top of it. The triangle's position and scale might need adjustment depending on the image size and aspect ratio. The conversion from the original 2D coordinates to Three.js coordinates might need fine-tuning based on your specific image and canvas dimensions.

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">How would I translate these coordinates to three.js coordinates in javascript?</span>

```js
// Define the coordinates of the triangle's vertices
const triangleCoords = [
  {x: 100, y: 100}, // Vertex A
  {x: 300, y: 100}, // Vertex B
  {x: 200, y: 300}  // Vertex C
];
```

To translate the given 2D image coordinates to Three.js 3D coordinates, you need to normalize these coordinates relative to the image size and then map them to the Three.js coordinate system, which ranges from -1 to 1 in both the x and y dimensions for objects positioned directly in front of the camera.

Assuming an image size for normalization purposes (let's use 400x400 pixels as an example, but you should replace these values with the actual size of your image or canvas), you can convert the given coordinates as follows:

1. **Normalize the Coordinates**: Convert the pixel coordinates to a range of 0 to 1, where 0 is the image's left or top edge, and 1 is its right or bottom edge.
2. **Map to Three.js Coordinates**: Map the normalized coordinates to the range of -1 to 1, which Three.js uses.

Here's how you can do it in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Given coordinates
const triangleCoords = [
  {x: 100, y: 100}, // Vertex A
  {x: 300, y: 100}, // Vertex B
  {x: 200, y: 300}  // Vertex C
];

// Image dimensions (replace with actual dimensions)
const imageWidth = 400;
const imageHeight = 400;

// Convert image coordinates to Three.js coordinates
const convertedCoords = triangleCoords.map(({x, y}) => {
  // Normalize coordinates (0 to 1)
  const normalizedX = x / imageWidth;
  const normalizedY = y / imageHeight;

  // Map to Three.js coordinates (-1 to 1)
  const threeX = normalizedX * 2 - 1; // Shift and scale x
  const threeY = (1 - normalizedY) * 2 - 1; // Invert, shift, and scale y (y is inverted in WebGL/Three.js)

  return { x: threeX, y: threeY };
});

console.log(convertedCoords);
```

This script first normalizes the given pixel coordinates to a 0 to 1 range, considering the provided example image size. Then, it maps these normalized coordinates to Three.js's -1 to 1 coordinate system. Note that the y-coordinate is inverted during this process because the WebGL (and thus Three.js) coordinate system has the positive y-direction pointing upwards, while in most 2D graphics systems, including HTML canvas, the positive y-direction points downwards.

Remember, this conversion assumes the triangle is to be positioned on a plane directly in front of the camera and that the plane covers the entire view. Adjustments might be necessary based on your specific scene setup, camera settings, and the actual size of the textures or elements you're working with in Three.js.

## Try again

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">The plane geometry is `THREE.PlaneGeometry(5, 5)`.  The image size is 400x300.  The triangle should be placed exactly where the coordinates say it should be placed; not simply in front of the camera.  What would the calculation look like then?</span>

Given a `THREE.PlaneGeometry(5, 5)` for the plane size and an image size of 400x300 pixels, the coordinates need to be translated considering the aspect ratio and scale of the plane relative to the image. Since the plane is a 5x5 square in Three.js units and the image is 400x300 pixels, the translation involves:

1. **Scaling the Image Coordinates**: Adjust the given image coordinates to the scale of the plane. This involves converting the pixel coordinates to Three.js world units, taking into account the plane size and image dimensions.
2. **Aspect Ratio Adjustment**: Ensure the aspect ratio of the image is considered in the translation to avoid distortion.

The plane's dimensions in Three.js units are uniform (5x5), but the image's aspect ratio is 4:3 (400 pixels wide by 300 pixels high). To map the image coordinates accurately onto the plane, you need to consider how the image would fit onto the plane while maintaining its aspect ratio.

Here's how to calculate the translation:

```javascript
// Given coordinates
const triangleCoords = [
  {x: 100, y: 100}, // Vertex A
  {x: 300, y: 100}, // Vertex B
  {x: 200, y: 300}  // Vertex C
];

// Image dimensions
const imageWidth = 400;
const imageHeight = 300;

// Plane dimensions in Three.js units
const planeWidth = 5;
const planeHeight = 5;

// Calculate scaling factors, assuming the plane is mapped to match the image's aspect ratio
const scaleX = planeWidth / imageWidth;
const scaleY = planeHeight / imageHeight;

// Convert image coordinates to Three.js world coordinates
const convertedCoords = triangleCoords.map(({x, y}) => {
  // Convert x, y from image pixels to Three.js world units
  let worldX = (x - imageWidth / 2) * scaleX;
  let worldY = (imageHeight / 2 - y) * scaleY; // Invert y-axis

  return { x: worldX, y: worldY };
});

console.log(convertedCoords);
```

This calculation centers the image on the plane by subtracting half the width and height of the image from the x and y coordinates, respectively, before scaling. This centers the (0,0) point of the Three.js coordinate system to the center of the image and the plane, ensuring that the triangle is placed accurately according to the original image coordinates.

This approach places the triangle exactly where the coordinates specify, scaled and positioned relative to the plane geometry in Three.js units, and maintains the correct aspect ratio of the image on the plane.

## Three back to image

The function you've provided attempts to convert Three.js coordinates back to image coordinates, but there's a mistake in the normalization step. The normalization process seems to be incorrectly applied when converting from Three.js coordinates to image coordinates. In Three.js, the coordinates are already in a normalized device coordinate (NDC) system ranging from -1 to 1, so you don't need to normalize them again based on the image dimensions. Instead, you directly map these NDC values to the image coordinate system.

Here's a corrected version of your function:

```javascript
function convertToImageCoordinates(positionArray, imageWidth, imageHeight) {
  const imageCoordinates = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < positionArray.length; i += 3) {
    // Extract the x and y coordinates from Three.js NDC space
    let threeX = positionArray[i];     // X coordinate in NDC
    let threeY = positionArray[i + 1]; // Y coordinate in NDC

    // Convert from NDC space [-1, 1] to image coordinates
    const imageX = (threeX + 1) / 2 * imageWidth;
    const imageY = (1 - threeY) / 2 * imageHeight;

    imageCoordinates.push({ x: imageX, y: imageY });
  }

  return imageCoordinates;
}
```

Here's the corrected process step-by-step:

1. **Direct Mapping from NDC to Image Coordinates**:
  - The NDC `x` values range from `-1` to `1`. Mapping this directly to the image coordinate system involves translating and scaling the NDC values to the `0` to `imageWidth` range. This is done by adding `1` to make the range `0` to `2`, dividing by `2` to make the range `0` to `1`, and then multiplying by `imageWidth`.
  - Similarly, for the NDC `y` values, after inverting the y-axis (because the NDC's positive y-direction is upwards while image coordinates have the positive y-direction downwards), you scale them to the `0` to `imageHeight` range.

2. **No Extra Normalization Needed**:
  - Since the coordinates are already in the normalized range of `-1` to `1`, you don't normalize them again using the image dimensions. The step that attempted to normalize the coordinates based on the image dimensions was removed.

This approach correctly maps the Three.js NDC coordinates back to the original image pixel coordinates.
