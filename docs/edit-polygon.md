## Edit Polygon

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">Can we allow further editing of the polygon by allowing the user to click a corner, or a point, and drag it to another location?</span>

Allowing users to edit a polygon by dragging its vertices to new locations is a great feature for enhancing interactivity and flexibility in your application. Implementing this functionality involves detecting a click near a vertex, enabling drag operations for that vertex, and updating the polygon's geometry based on the vertex's new position. Here's a high-level approach on how to achieve this in Three.js:

### Steps to Implement Vertex Editing

1. **Detect Clicks Near Vertices**: When the user clicks on the canvas, you need to determine if the click is near a vertex of the currently selected polygon. This can be done using raycasting to check for intersections with a small invisible sphere around each vertex or by calculating the distance between the click position and each vertex.

2. **Enable Dragging for a Selected Vertex**: Once a vertex is selected, you need to track mouse movements and update the vertex's position accordingly. This involves capturing `mousemove` events and recalculating the vertex's position based on the mouse's new location.

3. **Update the Polygon Geometry**: As the vertex is dragged, update the polygon's geometry to reflect the changes. This requires updating the positions in the geometry's `position` attribute and marking it for update.

4. **Finalize Vertex Position**: When the user releases the mouse button (`mouseup` event), finalize the vertex's new position and update the polygon geometry accordingly.

### Sample Code Outline

Below is a simplified code outline to help you get started with the implementation:

```javascript
let selectedVertexIndex = null;
let isVertexSelected = false;

function onMouseDown(event) {
    // Determine if the click is near a vertex
    let point = getMousePosition(event.clientX, event.clientY, canvas, camera);
    const nearestVertex = findNearestVertex(point);
    if (nearestVertex.distance <= someThresholdDistance) {
        isVertexSelected = true;
        selectedVertexIndex = nearestVertex.index;
        document.addEventListener('mousemove', onVertexDrag, false);
        document.addEventListener('mouseup', onVertexDragEnd, false);
    }
}

function onVertexDrag(event) {
    if (!isVertexSelected || selectedVertexIndex === null) return;
    let newPoint = getMousePosition(event.clientX, event.clientY, canvas, camera);
    // Update the selected vertex position
    points[selectedVertexIndex] = newPoint;
    updatePolygon(); // Update the polygon with the new vertex position
}

function onVertexDragEnd(event) {
    isVertexSelected = false;
    selectedVertexIndex = null;
    document.removeEventListener('mousemove', onVertexDrag, false);
    document.removeEventListener('mouseup', onVertexDragEnd, false);
}

function findNearestVertex(point) {
    // Implement logic to find the nearest vertex to the point
    // This should return the index of the nearest vertex and the distance
    let nearestIndex = -1;
    let nearestDistance = Infinity;
    points.forEach((vertex, index) => {
        let distance = calculateDistance(point, vertex); // Implement calculateDistance
        if (distance < nearestDistance) {
            nearestDistance = distance;
            nearestIndex = index;
        }
    });
    return { index: nearestIndex, distance: nearestDistance };
}

// Ensure you have logic to calculate distance between two points
function calculateDistance(point1, point2) {
    // Simple 2D distance calculation or 3D if you're working in three dimensions
}
```

### Considerations

- **Raycasting for Vertex Selection**: If your vertices are not visually represented by objects (e.g., spheres or dots), you might want to use invisible spheres for raycasting to detect clicks near vertices.
- **Threshold Distance**: Define a sensible threshold distance for how close a click must be to a vertex to consider it selected. This might depend on your application's scale and the user's expected precision.
- **Mouse Position Conversion**: The function `getMousePosition` should correctly translate the mouse's screen position to the coordinate system of your Three.js scene.
- **Event Listeners**: This example adds and removes event listeners for dragging. Ensure these are appropriately managed to prevent memory leaks or unintended behavior.

This outline gives you a starting point. You may need to adjust details based on your application's specifics, such as whether you're working in 2D or 3D space and how you're managing the scene and rendering loop.

## Draggable Polygon Vertex Update

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">Close, but it makes the polygon weird sometimes, and I can't create a 2nd polygon. Handle-less.</span>

To enable vertex updating when a user clicks and drags near a vertex, we'll need to modify your existing code to include functionality for detecting a click close to a vertex, initiating a drag operation to move the vertex, and updating the vertex position as the user drags it. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

1. **Detect Clicks Near Vertices**: Modify the `onMouseDown` function to check if the click was near any existing vertex. If it was, store the index of that vertex for updating.

2. **Implement Dragging**: Allow the user to drag the selected vertex. This will involve tracking mouse movements while the mouse button is pressed and updating the position of the selected vertex.

3. **Update Vertex Position**: During the drag operation, continuously update the position of the selected vertex in the `points` array and update the polygon display to reflect this change.

4. **Finalize the Update**: On mouse release (`onMouseUp`), finalize the position of the dragged vertex and update the polygon's geometry.

Here's how you can incorporate these steps into your code:

```javascript
export function polygon(scene, camera, renderer, controls) {
  // ...existing code...

  let draggingVertexIndex = null; // Index of the vertex being dragged

  function onMouseMove(event) {
    if (!isDrawing) return;

    // Dragging mode: if a vertex is being dragged, update its position
    if (mouseIsPressed && draggingVertexIndex !== null) {
      const point = getMousePosition(event.clientX, event.clientY, canvas, camera);
      points[draggingVertexIndex] = point; // Update the position of the dragged vertex
      updatePolygon();
    }
    // Drawing mode: update the last point position for new polygon drawing
    else if (mouseIsPressed && draggingVertexIndex === null && points.length > 0) {
      const point = getMousePosition(event.clientX, event.clientY, canvas, camera);
      points[points.length - 1] = point;
      updatePolygon();
    }
  }

  function onMouseDown(event) {
    if (!isDrawing) return;

    const point = getMousePosition(event.clientX, event.clientY, canvas, camera);
    // Check if the click is near an existing vertex for dragging
    const nearVertexIndex = findNearVertex(point, points);
    if (nearVertexIndex !== -1) {
      // Start dragging this vertex
      draggingVertexIndex = nearVertexIndex;
      mouseIsPressed = true;
    }
    // Start a new polygon or add a new vertex if not near an existing vertex
    else if (!mouseIsPressed) {
      mouseIsPressed = true;
      if (draggingVertexIndex === null) {
        points.push(point);
        if (!currentPolygon) {
          currentPolygon = createPolygon();
        }
      }
    }
  }

  function onMouseUp(event) {
    // Finalize dragging or adding a new vertex
    mouseIsPressed = false;
    if (draggingVertexIndex !== null) {
      // Finalize vertex position after dragging
      draggingVertexIndex = null;
    } else if (isDrawing) {
      // Add vertex on mouse up if not dragging
      updatePolygon();
    }
  }

  // Add a function to find a vertex near the click point
  function findNearVertex(point, vertices) {
    const threshold = 10; // Distance threshold to consider 'near'
    for (let i = 0; i < vertices.length; i++) {
      if (distanceBetween(point, vertices[i]) < threshold) {
        return i; // Return index of the near vertex
      }
    }
    return -1; // Return -1 if no vertex is near
  }

  // Calculate distance between two points (considering 3D space if necessary)
  function distanceBetween(point1, point2) {
    return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(point1.x - point2.x, 2) + Math.pow(point1.y - point2.y, 2) + Math.pow(point1.z - point2.z, 2));
  }

  // ...remaining existing code...
}
```

This updated code introduces the capability to click and drag a vertex to a new position. Here's a breakdown of the changes:

- **Dragging Vertex**: Added logic to track whether the user is dragging a vertex and which vertex is being dragged.
- **Vertex Position Update**: While dragging, continuously update the vertex's position in the `points` array and refresh the polygon display.
- **Finalize Drag**: Once the mouse button is released, finalize the position of the dragged vertex.

Make sure to adjust the `threshold` value in `findNearVertex` to suit your application's scale and sensitivity. This value determines how close a click must be to a vertex to start dragging it.

## Rectangle Edit

Yes, you can add an edit icon that allows users to manipulate points on a rectangle, enabling them to edit its shape directly within a Three.js scene. This process involves a few steps: displaying the edit icon, creating editable points (handles) on the rectangle's vertices, and implementing the logic to drag these points to reshape the rectangle.

This kind of functionality is often referred to as <mark>**"vertex manipulation"**</mark> or <mark>**"handle-based editing"**</mark> in the context of graphics and user interfaces.

Here's a high-level overview of how you could implement such a feature:

### 1. Add the Edit Icon

Similar to adding the delete icon, you would add an edit icon to the DOM when the user selects a rectangle or performs a specific action:

```html
<div id="editIcon" style="position: absolute; display: none;"><i class="fas fa-edit"></i></div>
```

And show it near the cursor or the selected object on specific events (like `mouseup` on the rectangle):

```javascript
// Example: Show the edit icon near the rectangle
function showEditIconAt(x, y) {
  const editIcon = document.getElementById('editIcon');
  editIcon.style.left = `${x}px`;
  editIcon.style.top = `${y}px`;
  editIcon.style.display = 'block';
}
```

### 2. Create Editable Points on the Rectangle

When the user clicks the edit icon, you would switch to edit mode. This involves creating visible, draggable points at the corners (and possibly along the edges) of the rectangle. These points could be implemented as small meshes (e.g., spheres or cubes) that are positioned at the rectangle's vertices.

### 3. Implement Dragging Logic

To enable dragging, you would need to implement logic that:

- Detects mouse down events on these points.
- Moves the point in response to mouse movement, updating the position in real-time.
- Adjusts the vertices of the rectangle's geometry based on the new positions of these points, effectively reshaping the rectangle.

You might use the `THREE.DragControls` or implement custom dragging logic to update the position of the points and consequently the shape of the rectangle.

### Code Snippet for Creating Handles and Dragging

Here's a very basic conceptual example of creating draggable points:

```javascript
// Assuming you have a function to add handles
function addEditHandles(rectangle) {
  const vertices = rectangle.geometry.vertices;
  vertices.forEach(vertex => {
    const handleGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(0.1, 32, 32);
    const handleMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0xff0000});
    const handle = new THREE.Mesh(handleGeometry, handleMaterial);
    handle.position.copy(vertex);
    scene.add(handle);
    // Add logic to make these handles draggable and update the rectangle vertices accordingly
  });
}
```

### Note:

Implementing this feature requires careful handling of 3D object transformations and event management. You would need to track the transformations applied to the editable points and update the rectangle's geometry accordingly. This might involve recalculating vertex positions and updating the geometry's `vertices` array followed by a call to `geometry.verticesNeedUpdate = true`.

This feature, while complex, can greatly enhance the interactivity and flexibility of your Three.js application by allowing users to edit shapes directly within the 3D scene.

### Make the handles draggable and update the rectangle vertices accordingly

Implementing fully functional drag-and-drop logic for vertex manipulation in Three.js directly within a simple text response is quite involved, but I can guide you through the basic concept and provide a starting point. For a complete solution, you would typically rely on more extensive event handling and Three.js's capabilities for intersecting rays with objects, as well as updating mesh geometries.

Here’s a simplified version to give you an idea of how it might work:

### 1. Set Up Raycaster for Dragging

Three.js's `Raycaster` is used to calculate the mouse's position in 3D space and detect intersections with objects in the scene.

```javascript
const raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();
const mouse = new THREE.Vector2();
```

### 2. Mouse Events

You need to listen for mouse events on the renderer's canvas. On `mousedown`, detect if a handle is clicked. On `mousemove`, if dragging, move the handle. On `mouseup`, release the handle.

```javascript
let selectedHandle = null;

canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', onDocumentMouseDown, false);
canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', onDocumentMouseMove, false);
canvas.addEventListener('mouseup', onDocumentMouseUp, false);

function onDocumentMouseDown(event) {
  // Update the mouse position
  mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
  mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;

  // Find intersections
  raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);
  const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(handles); // `handles` is an array of your draggable objects

  if (intersects.length > 0) {
    selectedHandle = intersects[0].object;
  }
}

function onDocumentMouseMove(event) {
  if (selectedHandle) {
    // Calculate new position of selectedHandle based on mouse movement
    // This is a simplified representation; actual implementation requires converting mouse coordinates to 3D space
    mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
    mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;

    raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);
    const intersects = raycaster.intersectObject(plane); // Assuming `plane` is a large invisible plane for easy raycasting

    if (intersects.length > 0) {
      selectedHandle.position.copy(intersects[0].point);
      // Here you would also update the rectangle's geometry based on the handle's new position
    }
  }
}

function onDocumentMouseUp(event) {
  selectedHandle = null; // Release the selected handle
}
```

### 3. Updating the Rectangle's Geometry

When you move a handle, you need to update the corresponding vertex in the rectangle's geometry and refresh the geometry:

```javascript
function updateRectangleGeometry(handle) {
  // Determine which vertex the handle corresponds to
  // This requires you to maintain a reference from handles to vertices

  // Update the vertex position
  const vertexIndex = handle.userData.vertexIndex; // Assuming you've stored a reference in userData
  rectangle.geometry.vertices[vertexIndex].copy(handle.position);
  rectangle.geometry.verticesNeedUpdate = true;
}
```

### Important Notes

- **Mouse to 3D Space Conversion**: The tricky part in the mouse event handlers is accurately converting the 2D mouse coordinates into 3D space coordinates where the handles are. This often involves using a `THREE.Plane` that the raycaster can use to determine where the mouse ray intersects the plane, providing a 3D position to move the handle to.
- **Performance Considerations**: Continuously updating geometry can be performance-intensive, especially for complex shapes or many vertices. Optimizations may be necessary for a smooth user experience.
- **Complexity of Implementation**: Depending on the specifics of your application (e.g., camera type, scene setup), you might need to adjust the approach for converting mouse positions to 3D coordinates.

This overview provides a conceptual starting point. For a complete and functional implementation, you would need to flesh out the details, especially around converting 2D mouse coordinates to 3D positions and handling the complexities of user interaction in a 3D environment.

## Vertex undefined

If `rectangle.geometry.vertices` is undefined, it's likely because you're using a more recent version of Three.js where the geometry class has been updated. In recent versions, `THREE.Geometry` has been replaced with `THREE.BufferGeometry`, which doesn't use the `vertices` array directly. Instead, `BufferGeometry` manages vertices through buffer attributes.

For `THREE.BufferGeometry`, vertex positions are stored in a `BufferAttribute` accessible via `geometry.attributes.position`. Here’s how you can access and modify vertex positions with `BufferGeometry`:

### Accessing Vertex Positions

To access vertex positions in a `BufferGeometry`, you use the `position` attribute. This attribute is a `BufferAttribute` or `InterleavedBufferAttribute` containing the vertex positions in a flat array where every three values represent the x, y, and z coordinates of a vertex.

### Example: Creating Edit Handles for a Rectangle

Assuming your rectangle is using `BufferGeometry`, you can create edit handles as follows:

```javascript
function addEditHandles(rectangle) {
  // Access the position attribute of the geometry
  const positions = rectangle.geometry.attributes.position;
  const vertices = positions.array;

  for (let i = 0; i < vertices.length; i += 3) {
    const x = vertices[i];
    const y = vertices[i + 1];
    const z = vertices[i + 2];

    const handleGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(0.1, 32, 32);
    const handleMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0xff0000});
    const handle = new THREE.Mesh(handleGeometry, handleMaterial);

    // Set the position of the handle
    handle.position.set(x, y, z);

    // Add the handle to the scene (assuming 'scene' is your THREE.Scene object)
    scene.add(handle);

    // Optionally, store a reference back to the vertex index
    handle.userData.vertexIndex = i / 3; // This is the index in the vertices array
    // You'll need this for updating the geometry later
  }
}
```

### Updating Vertex Positions

To update a vertex position in response to dragging a handle, you would modify the values in the `positions.array` directly and then notify Three.js that the attribute needs to be updated:

```javascript
// Example: Assuming you've moved a handle and want to update the corresponding vertex
function updateVertexPosition(handle) {
  const vertexIndex = handle.userData.vertexIndex;
  const newPosition = handle.position;

  // Update the position attribute
  const positions = rectangle.geometry.attributes.position;
  positions.array[vertexIndex * 3] = newPosition.x;
  positions.array[vertexIndex * 3 + 1] = newPosition.y;
  positions.array[vertexIndex * 3 + 2] = newPosition.z;

  // Mark the attribute as needing an update
  positions.needsUpdate = true;

  // If your geometry uses normals, you might need to update them as well
}
```

This method directly manipulates the vertices of your geometry, allowing for dynamic editing of shapes in your Three.js scene. Note that handling user interaction for dragging and updating these handles in real-time will require additional logic to detect mouse events and translate them into 3D space movements, as outlined in previous responses.

## Handles

Connecting the `updateVertexPosition(handle)` function to the handles involves detecting mouse events (such as mouse down, mouse move, and mouse up) on the handles and updating the vertex position based on the handle's new position. This requires setting up event listeners for mouse interactions and implementing logic to move the handles in response to these interactions. Here's how you can approach it:

### 1. Setup Mouse Event Listeners

First, you need to add event listeners to your Three.js canvas to track mouse movements and identify when a handle is being dragged. You'll use raycasting to detect which handle is under the mouse cursor.

```javascript
let selectedHandle = null;
let isDragging = false;

renderer.domElement.addEventListener('mousedown', onMouseDown, false);
renderer.domElement.addEventListener('mousemove', onMouseMove, false);
window.addEventListener('mouseup', onMouseUp, false); // Listen on window to handle mouse up outside the canvas

const raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();
const mouse = new THREE.Vector2();
```

### 2. Implement Mouse Down Handler

The `onMouseDown` function updates the mouse position, performs raycasting to find intersects with handles, and sets the selected handle for dragging.

```javascript
function onMouseDown(event) {
    event.preventDefault();

    mouse.x = (event.clientX / renderer.domElement.clientWidth) * 2 - 1;
    mouse.y = -(event.clientY / renderer.domElement.clientHeight) * 2 + 1;

    raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);
    const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children); // Assuming handles are direct children of the scene

    if (intersects.length > 0 && intersects[0].object.userData.isHandle) { // Make sure to mark your handles with userData.isHandle = true
        selectedHandle = intersects[0].object;
        isDragging = true;
    }
}
```

### 3. Implement Mouse Move Handler

The `onMouseMove` function updates the position of the selected handle if `isDragging` is true. This is where you'll need to map the 2D mouse position to a 3D point in your scene, which can be complex depending on your camera setup. A simple approach is to project the mouse movement onto a plane parallel to the camera's view.

```javascript
function onMouseMove(event) {
    if (isDragging && selectedHandle) {
        event.preventDefault();

        mouse.x = (event.clientX / renderer.domElement.clientWidth) * 2 - 1;
        mouse.y = -(event.clientY / renderer.domElement.clientHeight) * 2 + 1;

        raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);

        // Assuming there's a "dragPlane" in the scene that represents the plane you're dragging the handles on
        const intersects = raycaster.intersectObject(dragPlane);

        if (intersects.length > 0) {
            selectedHandle.position.copy(intersects[0].point);
            updateVertexPosition(selectedHandle); // Update the geometry of the rectangle
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Implement Mouse Up Handler

The `onMouseUp` function resets the dragging state.

```javascript
function onMouseUp(event) {
    isDragging = false;
    selectedHandle = null;
}
```

### Additional Considerations

- **Dragging Plane**: The approach assumes you have a plane (`dragPlane`) for calculating the drag position. This could be an invisible `THREE.PlaneGeometry` object positioned to catch the raycast from the mouse move. The orientation and position of this plane depend on your application's specifics, such as whether you're editing in 2D or 3D space.
- **Performance**: Attaching event listeners directly to DOM elements for each handle can lead to performance issues. It's more efficient to use raycasting from the canvas level, as shown above, to detect interactions with handles.
- **3D Position Mapping**: Mapping the mouse position to a 3D point accurately, especially in a perspective scene, requires careful consideration. The method shown uses a simple plane intersection, but depending on your scene's specifics, you might need a more complex approach.

By following these steps, you can create a user interface in Three.js that allows users to interactively edit the vertices of a rectangle by dragging handles.

## Implement it

Integrating handle movement and vertex update logic into your existing code requires adding mouse event handling specifically for the edit handles. Since you're already using event listeners for drawing the rectangle, we'll need to carefully integrate this to avoid conflicts and ensure that the rectangle editing logic only engages when an edit handle is selected.

Below is an integrated approach, focusing on the necessary adjustments and additions:

### Modify the `addEditHandles` Function

First, ensure that each handle has a way to be identified as such and has a reference back to its associated rectangle. This is crucial for the event handling logic to differentiate between drawing new rectangles and editing existing ones.

```javascript
function addEditHandles(rectangle) {
    const positions = rectangle.geometry.attributes.position;
    const vertices = positions.array;

    for (let i = 0; i < vertices.length; i += 3) {
        const x = vertices[i];
        const y = vertices[i + 1];
        const z = vertices[i + 2];

        const handleGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(0.1, 32, 32); // Adjust size as needed
        const handleMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0xff0000});
        const handle = new THREE.Mesh(handleGeometry, handleMaterial);

        handle.position.set(x, y, z);
        handle.userData = {isHandle: true, vertexIndex: i / 3, parentRectangle: rectangle};
        scene.add(handle);
    }
}
```

### Integrate Handle Selection and Movement

You'll need to modify your mouse event handling to support selecting and moving these handles. This involves checking if a mousedown event occurs on a handle and then updating the corresponding vertex of the rectangle on mousemove. Since you have a unified mouse event system for drawing and editing, you'll need to conditionally execute different logic based on what the user is doing.

You can integrate this logic into your existing mouse event handlers or create separate ones for edit mode. For clarity and to avoid disrupting your drawing logic, I'll show you how to adjust the existing handlers to accommodate handle dragging:

### Modify Mouse Event Handlers

Assuming you're using a single set of event listeners for both drawing and editing, you'll need to distinguish between these actions within the handlers. You can use a flag or check what's currently being interacted with to decide the behavior.

```javascript
let draggingHandle = false;
let selectedHandle = null;

function onMouseDown(event) {
    if (!isDrawing) { // Assume isDrawing is false when in edit mode
        mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
        mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;
        raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);
        const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true);

        if (intersects.length > 0 && intersects[0].object.userData.isHandle) {
            controls.enabled = false; // Disable orbit controls while dragging
            draggingHandle = true;
            selectedHandle = intersects[0].object;
            return; // Skip rectangle creation logic
        }
    }

    // Existing drawing logic...
}

function onMouseMove(event) {
    if (draggingHandle && selectedHandle) {
        // Update handle and vertex position
        // This requires implementing logic similar to what was outlined previously
        // for converting mouse coordinates to 3D space and moving the handle

        // Skipping detailed implementation for brevity
    } else if (isDrawing && mouseIsPressed) {
        // Existing rectangle update logic...
    }
}

function onMouseUp(event) {
    if (draggingHandle && selectedHandle) {
        updateVertexPosition(selectedHandle);
        draggingHandle = false;
        selectedHandle = null;
        controls.enabled = true; // Re-enable orbit controls
    } else if (isDrawing) {
        // Existing logic to finalize rectangle drawing...
    }
}
```

### Update the Vertex Position

The `updateVertexPosition` function needs a slight adjustment to reference the correct rectangle geometry, as it's called with a handle, not the rectangle itself.

```javascript
function updateVertexPosition(handle) {
    const vertexIndex = handle.userData.vertexIndex;
    const parentRectangle = handle.userData.parentRectangle;
    const positions = parentRectangle.geometry.attributes.position;

    positions.array[vertexIndex * 3] = handle.position.x;
    positions.array[vertexIndex * 3 + 1] = handle.position.y;
    positions.array[vertexIndex * 3 + 2] = handle.position.z;

    positions.needsUpdate = true;
}
```

### Final Notes

- **Disabling Other Interactions:** When in edit mode (i.e., when dragging a handle), make sure other interactions like canvas orbiting (if you're using `OrbitControls`) or drawing new rectangles are temporarily disabled to prevent conflicting actions.
- **Raycasting for Handles:** Ensure that your raycasting logic correctly identifies handles among other objects in the scene.
