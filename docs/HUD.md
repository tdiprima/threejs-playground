## Create 3D HUD in three.js

<span style="color:blue;">A head-up display, or [heads-up display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-up_display), also known as a HUD or head-up guidance system (HGS), is any transparent display that presents data without requiring users to look away from their usual viewpoints.</span>

Creating a cool heads-up display (HUD) in a scene using three.js involves several steps. Here's a general approach to achieve this:

1. **Basic Setup of the Scene**:
   - Initialize a basic three.js scene with a camera and a renderer.
   - Add any necessary objects to your scene that you want to be a part of the main 3D environment.

2. **Creating the HUD Elements**:
   - The HUD is typically an overlay on top of your 3D scene. You can create it using a separate scene or by overlaying 2D elements on the canvas.
   - If you are using a separate scene for HUD, you need a second orthographic camera. This camera ensures that the HUD elements do not scale when the scene is zoomed in or out.

3. **Designing the HUD**:
   - The HUD can include various elements like health bars, ammo counters, maps, or any other informational graphics.
   - These elements can be created using basic geometries like planes or boxes in three.js, or by using HTML/CSS elements overlaid on the canvas.

4. **Updating the HUD**:
   - The HUD elements should be dynamic, updating in real-time to reflect changes in the game or application state.
   - This involves writing JavaScript functions that update the HUD elements based on the state of the application.

5. **Rendering the HUD with the Scene**:
   - If using a separate scene for the HUD, you need to render both the main scene and the HUD scene in your animation loop.
   - Ensure the HUD is rendered on top of the main scene. This might involve careful management of the rendering order.

6. **Interactivity**:
   - If your HUD elements need to be interactive (like buttons or sliders), you'll need to implement event listeners and handlers.
   - You may use raycasting for 3D elements or standard DOM events for HTML/CSS-based HUD elements.

7. **Optimization**:
   - Make sure that the HUD is not overly complex as it could impact the performance of your application.
   - Efficiently manage the updates to the HUD to minimize performance overhead.

8. **Styling**:
   - Use colors, transparency, and textures to make the HUD visually appealing and aligned with the overall design of your scene.

9. **Testing**:
   - Continuously test the HUD in various scenarios to ensure it behaves as expected.

10. **Refinement and Expansion**:
   - Based on testing and feedback, refine the HUD elements.
   - You can also expand the HUD functionality as needed.

This is a high-level overview and the specifics can vary greatly based on the exact requirements and design of your HUD and scene. For detailed coding instructions, you would need to refer to the three.js documentation and possibly look at examples or tutorials specific to HUD creation in three.js.

## Make one!

<span style="color:#59acf3;font-size:larger;">HUD.html</span>

To add a transparent, movable rectangle in the upper left-hand corner of your three.js scene that displays the x, y, z coordinates of the blue box as it moves, you'll need to create an HTML overlay for the HUD and update it dynamically with the cube's position. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:

1. **Create an HTML Overlay for the HUD**:
   - Add a `div` element in your HTML file, style it to be transparent and position it in the upper left-hand corner.

2. **Update the HUD with Cube's Coordinates**:
   - Inside your animation loop, update the HUD with the cube's current position.

This code will create a simple HUD in the upper left corner of the screen that updates with the position of the cube. The position is rounded to two decimal places for readability. If the cube's position doesn't change (as in your current code), you might want to add some movement or allow user interaction to see the HUD update dynamically.

## Draggable

To allow users to move the HUD `<div>` element around the screen, you can implement a draggable functionality using JavaScript. This involves adding event listeners for mouse events (like `mousedown`, `mousemove`, and `mouseup`) and updating the position of the `<div>` based on these events. Here's how you can implement this:

1. **Add CSS for Cursor Change**: Update the CSS for the HUD `<div>` to change the cursor to indicate that it's draggable.

2. **Implement Draggable Logic**:
   - Add a `mousedown` event listener to start the dragging process.
   - Add `mousemove` and `mouseup` event listeners to handle the dragging movement and releasing the drag, respectively.

In this implementation:
- The `mousedown` event on the HUD sets the `isDragging` flag to `true` and records the initial mouse position.
- The `mousemove` event on the document updates the position of the HUD when dragging.
- The `mouseup` event on the document stops the dragging process.

Now, when you click and hold the HUD `<div>`, you should be able to drag it around the screen.
