<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">Let's say I'm working with a whole slide image, where the zoom level matters.  Normally, you'd calculate:</span>

```js
let areaInMicrons = area / 16; // 1 micron² = 16 pixels² 
```

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">where area is in pixels.  What additional information would I need to account for the zoom level?</span>

To account for the zoom level when calculating the area in microns from pixels, you need to know the relationship between the pixel size at different zoom levels. Specifically, you need the following additional information:

1. **Pixel Size at a Reference Zoom Level**: The size of one pixel (in microns) at a specific reference zoom level. This information is often provided as part of the image metadata or can be obtained from the imaging system's specifications.

2. **Current Zoom Level**: The current zoom level of the image. This is typically expressed as a ratio or magnification factor relative to the reference zoom level.

3. **Reference Zoom Level**: The zoom level at which the pixel size is known. This serves as the baseline for calculating pixel size at other zoom levels.

## Area
With these pieces of information, you can calculate the actual area in microns² at any zoom level by adjusting for the change in pixel size:

1. **Calculate the pixel size at the current zoom level**:

   ```
   pixelSizeAtCurrentZoom = pixelSizeAtReferenceZoom / zoomFactor
   ```
   Here, `zoomFactor` is the ratio of the current zoom level to the reference zoom level.

2. **Calculate the area in microns²**:

   ```
   areaInMicrons = areaInPixels * (pixelSizeAtCurrentZoom)²
   ```

### Example

Suppose:

- The pixel size at the reference zoom level (let's say 1x) is 1 micron.
- The current zoom level is 2x, so the zoom factor is 2.
- The measured area in pixels at the current zoom level is 100 pixels².

The calculations would be:

- Pixel size at 2x: `1 micron / 2 = 0.5 microns`
- Area in microns²: `100 pixels² * (0.5 microns)² = 25 microns²`

This adjustment ensures that the calculated area in microns² accurately reflects the actual physical size, regardless of the zoom level.

<hr>

Certainly! You can calculate the area in microns² from pixels² considering the pixel size in JavaScript as follows:

### JavaScript Calculation

```javascript
// Pixel area and pixel size at the current zoom level
const areaInPixels = 100; // Example area in pixels²
const pixelSizeAtCurrentZoom = 0.5; // Pixel size in microns at the current zoom level

// Calculate the area in microns²
const areaInMicrons = areaInPixels * Math.pow(pixelSizeAtCurrentZoom, 2);

console.log(`Area in microns²: ${areaInMicrons}`);
```

### Explanation
1. **areaInPixels**: The area of the object in pixels².
2. **pixelSizeAtCurrentZoom**: The size of each pixel in microns at the current zoom level.
3. **Math.pow(pixelSizeAtCurrentZoom, 2)**: Squaring the pixel size to convert the area from pixels² to microns².

In this example:

- If `areaInPixels = 100` and `pixelSizeAtCurrentZoom = 0.5` microns, then:
- The `areaInMicrons = 100 * (0.5 * 0.5) = 25` microns².

This code snippet will correctly convert an area given in pixels² to microns² based on the provided pixel size.

## Perimeter

To calculate the perimeter in microns considering the zoom level, you will need to account for the change in pixel size due to zooming. The process is similar to calculating the area but involves converting linear measurements (distances) instead of areas.

### Information Needed:
1. **Pixel Size at a Reference Zoom Level**: The size of one pixel (in microns) at a specific reference zoom level.
2. **Current Zoom Level**: The current zoom level of the image, expressed as a magnification factor relative to the reference zoom level.
3. **Reference Zoom Level**: The zoom level at which the pixel size is known.

### Calculation Steps:

1. **Determine Pixel Size at Current Zoom Level**:
   - If the pixel size at the reference zoom level is known, you can calculate the pixel size at the current zoom level using the zoom factor.

   pixelSizeAtCurrentZoom = pixelSizeAtReferenceZoom / zoomFactor

2. **Convert Perimeter to Microns**:
   - Convert the perimeter from pixels to microns by multiplying the perimeter in pixels by the pixel size at the current zoom level.

   perimeterInMicrons = perimeterInPixels × pixelSizeAtCurrentZoom

### Example:

Suppose:

- The pixel size at the reference zoom level (1x) is 0.25 microns.
- The current zoom level is 4x, so the zoom factor is 4.
- The measured perimeter in pixels at the current zoom level is 2000 pixels.

#### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate the pixel size at the current zoom level**:

   `pixelSizeAtCurrentZoom = 0.25 microns / 4 = 0.0625 microns`

2. **Convert the perimeter to microns**:

   `perimeterInMicrons = 2000 pixels × 0.0625 microns/pixel = 125 microns`

So, the perimeter of the object is 125 microns when considering the zoom level and the corresponding pixel size. This adjustment ensures that the measurement reflects the true physical distance, regardless of the zoom level.
