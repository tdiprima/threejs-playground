## Raycasting Issue with Line2

```js
let intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true)
```

<span style="color:#0000dd;">"Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "count", instanceStart is undefined".</span>

The error suggests that there might be an issue with the objects you're trying to perform raycasting on. Changing `THREE.Line` to `Line2` might be the cause of the problem.

**`Line2` is not a native object type** in Three.js but rather a separate extension library called `THREE.Line2`.

<mark>It's possible that `Line2` objects don't have the necessary properties for raycasting that are expected by the `raycaster.intersectObjects()` method.</mark>

1. Use `THREE.Line` instead: Revert your code back to using `THREE.Line` objects instead of `Line2`. This way, you can rely on the built-in raycasting functionality provided by Three.js.

2. Implement custom raycasting for `Line2` objects: If you really need to use `Line2` objects and their unique features, you can create a custom raycasting function specifically designed to handle `Line2` objects. You would need to iterate over the vertices of each line segment and perform ray-plane intersection tests to determine if the ray intersects the line segment.

3. Check for compatibility issues: Make sure that you're using the correct version of `Line2` and that it is compatible with the version of Three.js you're using. There might be compatibility issues if you're using an outdated version of Three.js or if the `Line2` library is not compatible with your Three.js version.

I would recommend trying option 1 first, as it is the simplest solution. If `Line2` is a requirement for your project, you can explore option 2 or check for updated versions of the library that are compatible with your Three.js version.

## Line Thickness

<span style="color:#0000dd;">I couldn't change the line width thickness using Line, so I switched to Line2.  If there's an easy way to still use Line and LineBasicMaterial and be able to have a thicker line, that would be ideal.</span>

If you want to achieve thicker lines using `THREE.Line` and `LineBasicMaterial`, you can utilize the `linewidth` property of the material. However, note that the `linewidth` property only works on certain platforms, such as non-WebGL 1.0 contexts or systems that support the `OES_standard_derivatives` extension. It may not work universally across all devices.

```javascript
// Create a LineGeometry with your line points
const geometry = new THREE.LineGeometry();
geometry.setPositions([...]); // Set your line vertices

// Create a LineBasicMaterial
const material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000, linewidth: 5 });

// Create a Line using the geometry and material
const line = new THREE.Line(geometry, material);

// Add the line to your scene
scene.add(line);
```

In this example, `linewidth: 5` sets the line thickness to 5 units. Adjust the value as needed to achieve your desired thickness.

Keep in mind that the effectiveness of `linewidth` may vary depending on the platform and graphics capabilities of the user's device. If thick lines are crucial for your application, you might need to consider alternative approaches, such as using custom shaders or using a different library specifically designed for thick lines in WebGL.

## Yes, that's what I'm saying.  Actually linewidth is known not to work.

You are correct that the <mark>**`linewidth` property does not work reliably**</mark> in Three.js, particularly in modern WebGL contexts.

If you need to achieve thicker lines in Three.js, there are a couple of alternative approaches you can consider:

1. **Shader-based thick lines**: You can create custom shaders to render thick lines in Three.js. This approach involves using `BufferGeometry` to define the line segments and creating a custom shader to render the line with the desired thickness. Here's an example of how you can achieve thick lines using shaders: [Shader-based Thick Lines in Three.js](https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-lines.html)

2. **LineSegments**: Instead of using `Line` or `Line2`, you can use `LineSegments` in combination with `LineBasicMaterial`. `LineSegments` allows you to define individual line segments instead of a continuous line. Each segment can have its own color and thickness. Here's an example:

```javascript
// Create a LineSegmentsGeometry with your line segments
const geometry = new THREE.LineSegmentsGeometry();
geometry.setPositions([...]); // Set your line segment vertices

// Create a LineBasicMaterial
const material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000, linewidth: 1 });

// Create a LineSegments using the geometry and material
const line = new THREE.LineSegments(geometry, material);

// Add the line to your scene
scene.add(line);
```

In this approach, you define each line segment separately, allowing you to have varying thickness and color for different segments.

Keep in mind that both of these approaches have their own complexities and considerations. Shader-based thick lines provide more flexibility but require more advanced knowledge of shaders. LineSegments offer a simpler solution but are limited to defining separate line segments. Choose the approach that best suits your requirements and level of expertise.
