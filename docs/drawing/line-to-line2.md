## Convert Line3D

<span style="color:#997fff;">I have a three.js program that allows the user to free-draw on the canvas.  I want the line to be thicker, so I need to use a Line2 instead of THREE.Line.  But the coordinates that the Line2 is expecting, is different than what I'm passing to THREE.Line.  And I don't understand how to set the coordinates in the Line2.  Can you take this script (free1.js) and convert it to using Line2, with the correct coordinates?</span>

To convert the script to use `Line2` instead of `THREE.Line`, you'll need to make a few changes to the code. Here's the modified version:

```javascript
import * as THREE from "three";
import { OrbitControls } from "three/examples/controls/OrbitControls.js";
import { Line2 } from "three/examples/lines/Line2.js";
import { LineMaterial } from "three/examples/lines/LineMaterial.js";
import { LineGeometry } from "three/examples/lines/LineGeometry.js";
// He's actually right; it should be: "three/examples/jsm/lines/LineGeometry.js";

console.log(`%cREVISION: ${THREE.REVISION}`, "color: #ccff00;");
let btnDraw = document.getElementById("toggleButton");
let imageSource = "/images/image1.jpg";
let isDrawing = false;
let mouseIsPressed = false;
let positions = []; // Set up arrays to hold line data
let controls;
let color = "#0000ff";

let scene = new THREE.Scene();
let camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
camera.position.z = 5;
camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0));

let renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement);

btnDraw.addEventListener("click", function () {
  positions = [];
  if (isDrawing) {
    isDrawing = false;
    controls.enabled = true;

    renderer.domElement.removeEventListener("mousemove", onMouseMove);
    renderer.domElement.removeEventListener("mouseup", onMouseUp);
  } else {
    isDrawing = true;
    controls.enabled = false;

    // Set up the mouse event listeners
    renderer.domElement.addEventListener("mousemove", onMouseMove);
    renderer.domElement.addEventListener("mouseup", onMouseUp);
  }
});

let loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
let planeGeom = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(10, 10);
let texture = loader.load(imageSource);
let planeMat = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: texture, side: THREE.DoubleSide });
let plane = new THREE.Mesh(planeGeom, planeMat);
scene.add(plane);

let raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();
let mouse = new THREE.Vector2();

let material = new LineMaterial({ color });

let mesh;

renderer.domElement.addEventListener("pointerdown", (event) => {
  if (isDrawing) {
    mouseIsPressed = true;

    // Create a new LineGeometry for each line
    let lineGeometry = new LineGeometry();

    mesh = new Line2(lineGeometry, material);

    console.log("%cpositions", "color: #ccff00;", mesh.geometry.attributes.position.array);

    scene.add(mesh);
  }
});

function onMouseMove(event) {
  if (isDrawing && mouseIsPressed) {
    mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
    mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;

    raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);
    let intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true);

    if (intersects.length > 0) {
      let point = intersects[0].point;
      positions.push(point.x, point.y, point.z);

      let lineGeometry = mesh.geometry;
      lineGeometry.setPositions(positions);

      // Set needsUpdate to true for the position attribute
      lineGeometry.attributes.position.needsUpdate = true;
    }
  }
}

function onMouseUp() {
  if (isDrawing) {
    mouseIsPressed = false;

    let lineGeometry = mesh.geometry;
    lineGeometry.setDrawRange(0, positions.length / 3);
    lineGeometry.computeBoundingSphere();

    positions = [];
  }
}

window.addEventListener("resize", function () {
  renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
  camera.aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;
  camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
});

(function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  controls.update();
  // Fixed: "can't access property "count", instanceStart is undefined"
  material.resolution.set(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
})();
```

In the modified code, the following changes have been made:

1. Added the necessary imports for `Line2`, `LineMaterial`, and `LineGeometry`.
2. Replaced the material initialization with `LineMaterial` instead of `LineBasicMaterial`.
3. Changed the buffer geometry initialization to `LineGeometry`.
4. Replaced the creation of `THREE.Line` with `Line2`.
5. Replaced the method `mesh.geometry.setAttribute` with `lineGeometry.setPositions`.
6. Replaced `mesh.geometry.setDrawRange` with `lineGeometry.setDrawRange`.

These modifications should allow you to use `Line2` with the correct coordinates in your Three.js program.

## Error

<span style="color:#0000dd;">Thanks!  I have a problem, though - it errors on this line</span>

```js
let intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true);
```

<span style="color:#0000dd;">saying "Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "count", instanceStart is undefined".</span>

<span style="color:red;">Fixed!  See below.</span>

The error you're encountering typically occurs when the **`raycaster` intersects** an object that doesn't have any **geometry.**

To fix this issue, you can add a simple check to ensure that the intersected object has a **valid geometry** before attempting to access it. Here's an updated version of the `onMouseMove` function that includes the necessary check:

```javascript
function onMouseMove(event) {
  if (isDrawing && mouseIsPressed) {
    mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
    mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;

    raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);
    let intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true);

    if (intersects.length > 0) {
      let intersectedObject = intersects[0].object;
      if (intersectedObject.geometry) {
        let point = intersects[0].point;
        positions.push(point.x, point.y, point.z);

        let lineGeometry = mesh.geometry;
        lineGeometry.setPositions(positions);

        // Set needsUpdate to true for the position attribute
        lineGeometry.attributes.position.needsUpdate = true;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

By **checking if `intersectedObject.geometry` exists** before proceeding, you can ensure that the error won't occur when attempting to access properties like `count` or `instanceStart`. This modification should resolve the error you encountered.

## That wasn't it (duh)

Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "count", instanceStart is undefined

### Update: Fixed!

```javascript
material.resolution.set(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
```

<span style="color:#0000dd;">Maybe if we knew what "count" or "instanceStart" they were talking about, we might be able to fix it.</span>

The error message you mentioned regarding "count" and "instanceStart" is **related to the internals of the `Line2`** implementation. To provide a more accurate solution, we need to analyze the issue further.

Upon reviewing the code, I noticed that there is a potential problem with the usage of the `LineGeometry` instance. Instead of directly initializing it with `lineGeometry = new LineGeometry()`, we should use `lineGeometry = new LineGeometry().setPositions([])` to explicitly set the positions array to an empty array. This will ensure that the `LineGeometry` instance has the necessary properties initialized correctly.

Here's the updated portion of the code:

```javascript
// Create a new LineGeometry for each line
let lineGeometry = new LineGeometry().setPositions([]);
```

By explicitly setting the positions array to an empty array, it should resolve the issue with the "count" and "instanceStart" error.

Nice try, but no.

## Array error

Uncaught RangeError: invalid array length
Line 64

This fixes it, but then we get some weird blob when drawing, which kinda makes sense:

```js
let lineGeometry = new LineGeometry()
      .setPositions(
        [-2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
      );
```

I thought since it's NEW for each line, it would get overwritten, but **it dunt.** <span style="color:red;">I'd love to know why.</span>

I went to `build` and I `ack`ed for "instanceStart", but came up with nothing.  What the h3ll?

# Intentar Otra Vez

<span style="color:#997fff;">Good morning, friend.  I did what you said, but it didn't like me passing an empty array to LineGeometry setPositions().  So I gave it an array.  I thought that since it's NEW for each line, it would get overwritten, but it doesn't.  So while it fixed the error, it didn't "work".  So I went back to the original error "instanceStart is undefined".  I scanned the three.js script itself for "instanceStart" but did not find anything.  So then I searched for "count" and got overwhelmed.  It seems like many objects have it including BufferAttribute.</span>

The error message you're encountering regarding "instanceStart" and "count" is related to the internals of the `Line2` implementation, as you mentioned. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#0000dd;">I know...</span>

Upon further investigation, it seems there's an issue with how the `LineMaterial` is being set up and used.

To resolve the issue, we'll need to make some changes to ensure the `LineMaterial` is set up correctly and compatible with `Line2`.

```javascript
import * as THREE from "three";
import { OrbitControls } from "three/examples/controls/OrbitControls.js";
import { Line2 } from "three/examples/jsm/lines/Line2.js";
import { LineMaterial } from "three/examples/jsm/lines/LineMaterial.js";
import { LineGeometry } from "three/examples/jsm/lines/LineGeometry.js";

console.log(`%cREVISION: ${THREE.REVISION}`, "color: #ccff00;");
let btnDraw = document.getElementById("toggleButton");
let imageSource = "/images/image1.jpg";
let isDrawing = false;
let mouseIsPressed = false;
let positions = []; // Set up arrays to hold line data
let controls;
let color = "#0000ff";

let scene = new THREE.Scene();
let camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
camera.position.z = 5;
camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0));

let renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement);

btnDraw.addEventListener("click", function () {
  positions = [];
  if (isDrawing) {
    isDrawing = false;
    controls.enabled = true;

    renderer.domElement.removeEventListener("mousemove", onMouseMove);
    renderer.domElement.removeEventListener("mouseup", onMouseUp);
  } else {
    isDrawing = true;
    controls.enabled = false;

    // Set up the mouse event listeners
    renderer.domElement.addEventListener("mousemove", onMouseMove);
    renderer.domElement.addEventListener("mouseup", onMouseUp);
  }
});

let loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
let planeGeom = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(10, 10);
let texture = loader.load(imageSource);
let planeMat = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: texture, side: THREE.DoubleSide });
let plane = new THREE.Mesh(planeGeom, planeMat);
scene.add(plane);

let raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();
let mouse = new THREE.Vector2();

// Create a new LineMaterial instance with appropriate parameters
let material = new LineMaterial({
  color: new THREE.Color(color),
  linewidth: 5, // Adjust the line thickness as needed
  resolution: new THREE.Vector2(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight),
});

let mesh;

renderer.domElement.addEventListener("pointerdown", (event) => {
  if (isDrawing) {
    mouseIsPressed = true;

    // Create a new LineGeometry for each line
    let lineGeometry = new LineGeometry();

    // Set the initial positions to an empty array
    lineGeometry.setPositions(positions); // It's LITERALLY the same thing

    mesh = new Line2(lineGeometry, material);

    scene.add(mesh);
  }
});

function onMouseMove(event) {
  if (isDrawing && mouseIsPressed) {
    mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
    mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;

    raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);
    let intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true);

    if (intersects.length > 0) {
      let intersectedObject = intersects[0].object;
      if (intersectedObject.geometry) {
        let point = intersects[0].point;
        positions.push(point.x, point.y, point.z);

        let lineGeometry = mesh.geometry;
        lineGeometry.setPositions(positions);

        // Set needsUpdate to true for the position attribute
        lineGeometry.attributes.position.needsUpdate = true;
      }
    }
  }
}

function onMouseUp() {
  if (isDrawing) {
    mouseIsPressed = false;

    let lineGeometry = mesh.geometry;
    lineGeometry.setDrawRange(0, positions.length / 3);
    lineGeometry.computeBoundingSphere();

    positions = [];
  }
}

window.addEventListener("resize", function () {
  renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
  camera.aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;
  camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
});

(function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  controls.update();
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
})();
```

<br>
In the updated code, the key changes include:

1. Initializing the `LineMaterial` with the appropriate parameters, such as `color`, `linewidth`, and `resolution`.
2. Setting the initial positions of the `LineGeometry` to an empty array using `lineGeometry.setPositions(positions)`.
3. Adjusting the line thickness by modifying the `linewidth` parameter in the `LineMaterial` constructor.
4. Setting the `resolution` parameter of the `LineMaterial` to match the renderer's width and height.

These modifications should help resolve the issue and allow you to use `Line2` with the correct coordinates while avoiding the "instanceStart" and "count" errors.

## No. Array length.

<span style="color:#0000dd;">It errors on line 70, where we Set the initial positions to an empty array.  It says "Uncaught RangeError: invalid array length".</span>

The error you're encountering on line 70 is due to an invalid array length when attempting to set the initial positions as an empty array. To fix this issue, you can set the initial positions as an array with a single point, which <mark>**will be overwritten**</mark> with actual positions later.

```javascript
renderer.domElement.addEventListener("pointerdown", (event) => {
  if (isDrawing) {
    mouseIsPressed = true;

    // Create a new LineGeometry for each line
    let lineGeometry = new LineGeometry();

    // Set initial positions with a single point
    lineGeometry.setPositions([0, 0, 0]);

    mesh = new Line2(lineGeometry, material);

    scene.add(mesh);
  }
});
```

By setting the initial positions as `[0, 0, 0]`, we provide a valid array length to the `setPositions` method. Later, these initial positions will be overwritten with the actual positions captured during the mouse movement.

## Por favor...

<span style="color:#0000dd;">Well, it worked in the sense that we no longer have an error.  But now the line does not get drawn to the screen.  I printed out the value of  mesh.geometry.attributes.position.array, which is [-1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, -1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, -1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0].  You know &ndash; I don't know if that is correct for a Line2 or not. :(</span>

It seems that the incorrect initial positions are causing the line not to be rendered correctly. Instead of providing arbitrary initial positions, let's modify the code to ensure the line is visible from the start.

```javascript
renderer.domElement.addEventListener("pointerdown", (event) => {
  if (isDrawing) {
    mouseIsPressed = true;

    // Create a new LineGeometry for each line
    let lineGeometry = new LineGeometry();

    // Set initial positions as a line with zero length
    lineGeometry.setPositions([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]);

    mesh = new Line2(lineGeometry, material);

    scene.add(mesh);
  }
});
```

<br>

By setting the initial positions as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, we create a line with zero length at the origin. As you start drawing and capturing the actual positions, these initial positions will be overwritten, and the line will be updated accordingly.

Please give this modification a try, and the line should now be visible when you start drawing.

## Same coordinates

<span style="color:#0000dd;">The line still doesn't get drawn.  But - I see that no matter where I draw the line, the coordinates are always the same.</span>

It seems that there was an oversight in the code. The issue lies in the `onMouseMove` function where the positions are not being correctly updated. Let's modify the code to correctly update the positions based on the mouse movement.

```javascript
function onMouseMove(event) {
  if (isDrawing && mouseIsPressed) {
    mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
    mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;

    raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);
    let intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true);

    if (intersects.length > 0) {
      let intersectedObject = intersects[0].object;
      if (intersectedObject.geometry) {
        let point = intersects[0].point;

        let lineGeometry = mesh.geometry;

        // Update the positions array of the LineGeometry
        let positionsArray = lineGeometry.attributes.position.array;
        positionsArray[3] = point.x;
        positionsArray[4] = point.y;
        positionsArray[5] = point.z;

        // Set needsUpdate to true for the position attribute
        lineGeometry.attributes.position.needsUpdate = true;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<br>

In the updated code, we access the `positionsArray` directly from the `lineGeometry.attributes.position.array` and update the specific indices `[3]`, `[4]`, and `[5]` to store the current point captured from the mouse movement.

Please try this modification, and the line should now be updated correctly based on your mouse movement.

[-1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, -1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, -1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0]

[-1, 2, 0, 0.3403858542442322, 0.004862654954195023, 0, -1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, -1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0]

It looks like the same exact bloody thing, except for 2 points.

# No.

This is the part where I give up, because we're just going round in circles.
