## Convert Line3D

I have a three.js program that allows the user to free-draw on the canvas.  I want the line to be thicker, so I need to use a Line2 instead of THREE.Line.  But the coordinates that the Line2 is expecting, is different than what I'm passing to THREE.Line.  And I don't understand how to set the coordinates in the Line2.  Can you take this script (free1.js) and convert it to using Line2, with the correct coordinates?

To convert the script to use `Line2` instead of `THREE.Line`, you'll need to make a few changes to the code. Here's the modified version:

```javascript
import * as THREE from "three";
import { OrbitControls } from "three/examples/controls/OrbitControls.js";
import { Line2 } from "three/examples/lines/Line2.js";
import { LineMaterial } from "three/examples/lines/LineMaterial.js";
import { LineGeometry } from "three/examples/lines/LineGeometry.js";
// He's actually right; it should be: "three/examples/jsm/lines/LineGeometry.js";

console.log(`%cREVISION: ${THREE.REVISION}`, "color: #ccff00;");
let btnDraw = document.getElementById("toggleButton");
let imageSource = "/images/image1.jpg";
let isDrawing = false;
let mouseIsPressed = false;
let positions = []; // Set up arrays to hold line data
let controls;
let color = "#0000ff";

let scene = new THREE.Scene();
let camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
camera.position.z = 5;
camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0));

let renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement);

btnDraw.addEventListener("click", function () {
  positions = [];
  if (isDrawing) {
    isDrawing = false;
    controls.enabled = true;

    renderer.domElement.removeEventListener("mousemove", onMouseMove);
    renderer.domElement.removeEventListener("mouseup", onMouseUp);
  } else {
    isDrawing = true;
    controls.enabled = false;

    // Set up the mouse event listeners
    renderer.domElement.addEventListener("mousemove", onMouseMove);
    renderer.domElement.addEventListener("mouseup", onMouseUp);
  }
});

let loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
let planeGeom = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(10, 10);
let texture = loader.load(imageSource);
let planeMat = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: texture, side: THREE.DoubleSide });
let plane = new THREE.Mesh(planeGeom, planeMat);
scene.add(plane);

let raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();
let mouse = new THREE.Vector2();

let material = new LineMaterial({ color });

let mesh;

renderer.domElement.addEventListener("pointerdown", (event) => {
  if (isDrawing) {
    mouseIsPressed = true;

    // Create a new LineGeometry for each line
    let lineGeometry = new LineGeometry();

    mesh = new Line2(lineGeometry, material);

    console.log("%cmesh.geometry", "color: #ccff00;", mesh.geometry);

    scene.add(mesh);
  }
});

function onMouseMove(event) {
  if (isDrawing && mouseIsPressed) {
    mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
    mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;

    raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);
    let intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true);

    if (intersects.length > 0) {
      let point = intersects[0].point;
      positions.push(point.x, point.y, point.z);

      let lineGeometry = mesh.geometry;
      lineGeometry.setPositions(positions);

      // Set needsUpdate to true for the position attribute
      lineGeometry.attributes.position.needsUpdate = true;
    }
  }
}

function onMouseUp() {
  if (isDrawing) {
    mouseIsPressed = false;

    let lineGeometry = mesh.geometry;
    lineGeometry.setDrawRange(0, positions.length / 3);
    lineGeometry.computeBoundingSphere();

    positions = [];
  }
}

window.addEventListener("resize", function () {
  renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
  camera.aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;
  camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
});

(function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  controls.update();
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
})();
```

In the modified code, the following changes have been made:

1. Added the necessary imports for `Line2`, `LineMaterial`, and `LineGeometry`.
2. Replaced the material initialization with `LineMaterial` instead of `LineBasicMaterial`.
3. Changed the buffer geometry initialization to `LineGeometry`.
4. Replaced the creation of `THREE.Line` with `Line2`.
5. Replaced the method `mesh.geometry.setAttribute` with `lineGeometry.setPositions`.
6. Replaced `mesh.geometry.setDrawRange` with `lineGeometry.setDrawRange`.

These modifications should allow you to use `Line2` with the correct coordinates in your Three.js program.

## Error

Thanks!  I have a problem, though - it errors on this line `let intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true);`, saying "Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "count", instanceStart is undefined".  Any ideas?

The error you're encountering typically occurs when the `raycaster` intersects an object that doesn't have any geometry. To fix this issue, you can add a simple check to ensure that the intersected object has a valid geometry before attempting to access it. Here's an updated version of the `onMouseMove` function that includes the necessary check:

```javascript
function onMouseMove(event) {
  if (isDrawing && mouseIsPressed) {
    mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
    mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;

    raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);
    let intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true);

    if (intersects.length > 0) {
      let intersectedObject = intersects[0].object;
      if (intersectedObject.geometry) {
        let point = intersects[0].point;
        positions.push(point.x, point.y, point.z);

        let lineGeometry = mesh.geometry;
        lineGeometry.setPositions(positions);

        // Set needsUpdate to true for the position attribute
        lineGeometry.attributes.position.needsUpdate = true;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

By checking if `intersectedObject.geometry` exists before proceeding, you can ensure that the error won't occur when attempting to access properties like `count` or `instanceStart`. This modification should resolve the error you encountered.

## Again.

Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "count", instanceStart is undefined

Maybe if we knew what "count" or "instanceStart" they were talking about, we might be able to fix it.

I apologize for the confusion. The error message you mentioned regarding "count" and "instanceStart" is related to the internals of the `Line2` implementation. To provide a more accurate solution, we need to analyze the issue further.

Upon reviewing the code, I noticed that there is a potential problem with the usage of the `LineGeometry` instance. Instead of directly initializing it with `lineGeometry = new LineGeometry()`, we should use `lineGeometry = new LineGeometry().setPositions([])` to explicitly set the positions array to an empty array. This will ensure that the `LineGeometry` instance has the necessary properties initialized correctly.

Here's the updated portion of the code:

```javascript
renderer.domElement.addEventListener("pointerdown", (event) => {
  if (isDrawing) {
    mouseIsPressed = true;

    // Create a new LineGeometry for each line
    let lineGeometry = new LineGeometry().setPositions([]);

    mesh = new Line2(lineGeometry, material);

    console.log("%cmesh.geometry", "color: #ccff00;", mesh.geometry);

    scene.add(mesh);
  }
});
```

By explicitly setting the positions array to an empty array, it should resolve the issue with the "count" and "instanceStart" error. Please give this modification a try and let me know if it resolves the problem for you.

## Grr!
